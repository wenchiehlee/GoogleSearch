* Operator
* Good day and welcome to the FactSet third-quarter earnings call.
* (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call may be recorded.
* I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Toomey, Head of Investor Relations.
* Please go ahead.

* Kevin Toomey - Investor Relations
* Thank you and good morning, everyone.
* Welcome to FactSet's third fiscal quarter 2025 earnings call.
* Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. A replay of today's call will be available on our website.
* After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions.
* The call is scheduled to last for one hour.
* (Operator Instructions)
* Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on slide 2.
* Discussions on this call may contain forward-looking statements.
* Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
* Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties can be found in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
* Our slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.
* For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today, both of which can be found on our website at investor.factset.com.
* During this call, unless otherwise noted, relative performance metrics reflect changes as compared to the respective fiscal 2024 period.
* Also, consistent with the last quarter, please note that starting fiscal 2025, FactSet is reporting organic ASV rather than organic ASV plus professional services to focus on the recurring nature of our revenues.
* Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer; and Goran Skoko, Chief Revenue Officer.
* I will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.

* F. Philip Snow - Chief Executive Officer, Director
* Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.
* Thanks for joining us today.
* Before we discuss our Q3 results, I just want to take a moment to recognize an important milestone for FactSet and for me personally.
* Earlier this month, we announced my decision to retire after 30 years with FactSet and the past decade as CEO.
* It's been a privilege to spend my career here working alongside such a talented, collaborative and mission-driven team.
* Together, we've expanded our data and workflow capabilities, deepened client relationships, and more than doubled our revenue over the past 10 years, positioning FactSet as a trusted global enterprise leader in powering smarter, data-driven investment decisions.
* It's been an incredible journey, and I'm proud of all we've accomplished together.
* Looking ahead, I'm even more confident in FactSet's future.
* I'm also pleased to share that Sanoke Viswanathan will become FactSet's next CEO in early September.
* Sanoke brings over 25 years of global leadership experience in financial services and technology, most recently at JPMorgan Chase.
* And he has a strong strategic mindset and a proven track record of delivering technology-driven growth at scale.
* As FactSet prepares for its next chapter of leadership, I'm proud of the solid foundation we've established built on innovation, client trust, and industry-leading data and workflow solutions.
* I'm confident Sanoke's leadership will guide FactSet through its next phase of growth and look forward to working with him closely to ensure a smooth and thoughtful transition.
