深耕本土、連結國際：本土諮商心理學學刊推出中英雙語全文版的脈絡

王智弘*    嚴嘉琪

摘要

現代心理學發展超過百年之後才有了本土諮商心理學發展的倡議，而本土諮商心理

學是本土社會科學與本土心理學的一環，本土諮商心理學學刊是基於倡議本土諮商心理

學發展而起的期刊，其是由國立彰化師範大學輔導與諮商學系本土諮商心理學研究發展

中心所發行的學術期刊，目的在推動本土諮商心理學的學術與實務研究，以發表輔導、

諮商心理、臨床心理、復健諮商、社會工作、精神醫學、精神護理、心理衛生、職能治

療、語言治療、特殊教育、員工協助方案等與心理學及助人專業相關學科之本土化專論

為主，為鼓勵本土化的研究，本學刊也接受跨領域的本土化社會科學研究論文，並接受

全球學者中文與英文稿件之投稿，考慮到中文是世界上最多人使用的語言，而英文是第

二名，而且後者在國際學術交流上的使用非常普及，本土諮商心理學學刊除了同時接受

兩種語言的投稿之外，自第十五卷開始（2024 年 3 月）開始以中、英雙語全文刊登，亦

即無論以中文投稿或是英文投稿，審查完成刊登時都將以雙語全文刊登，此等出刊方式

經過去年 14 卷第 3 期（2023 年 9 月）開始試辦兩期，獲得學術界許多正面的迴響，因

此，本刊確定從本年度與本期刊物開始，正式推出中、英雙語全文版，為迎接此一具有

挑戰性的新出刊任務，本刊也正式邀請具有中英文翻譯專業背景的嚴嘉琪主編加入編輯

團隊，嚴主編為美國印第安那大學（Bloomington）課程與教學博士，現任國立臺中科技

大學應用英語系教授，具有跨領域的學術專長。本刊感謝嚴主編的加入也感謝編輯委員

會所有編輯委員與國立彰化師範大學的長期支持，也希望有志於推動社會科學、心理學

與諮商心理學本土化的各國學者能給予支持與賜稿，讓本刊能不斷的進步與成長，而對

亞洲與全世界的學術本土化運動做出更多的貢獻。

關鍵詞：本土化、本土社會科學、本土心理學、本土諮商心理學

壹、從生理心理學到文化心理學

現代心理學的起源常被提及是起自 1879 年 12 月，德國的生理學家威廉·馮特

（Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt，1832－1920），在萊比錫大學三樓的小房間裏，創建了世

界第一個心理學實驗室，而開展了現代的心理學，馮特也是第一位自稱是「心理學家」

的人，在其生平的著作中有兩本頗受人矚目的書，其一是在其 42 歲那年出版的《生理

心理學原理》，此書可說是現代心理學開山之作；其二是在其 88 歲過世那年所出版，

耗費 20 年時間所寫成的十卷巨著：《民(cid:13687)心理學》，縱觀馮特的一生，其心理學研究從

著眼於個人之感覺、知覺等生理層面開始，而最後則著眼於群體之社會、民(cid:13687)等文化層

面，這標誌了一個心理學家的專業發展與心路歷程，也展現了心理學發展的多元意涵（王

智弘，2016）。心理學的生理層面值得研究，而心理學的文化層面也不能加以忽視，從

生理到文化都是心理學所涵蓋的內涵。

然而近代百年以來多數的心理學研究，對人類的文化層面上卻沒有整體性的觀照，

比如 Arnett（2008）即指出，在 2003-2007 年間，心理學六大領域主要期刊發表的文章，

有 68%研究的研究受試者是來自於美國，而即使累積研究受試者之比例至 96%，也僅來

自於人口比例佔 12%世界人口的西方工業化國家（歐洲、北美、澳洲或以色列）。難怪

有學者提醒說，過去西方心理學理論的研究可能是建立在一個怪異的樣本（WEIRD

sample）之上：所謂 WEIRD 指的是：西方的（Western），教育普及的（Educated），

工業化的（Industrialized），富有的（Rich），以及民主化的（Democratic）(Henrich et al.,

2010a, 2010b; Hwang, 2012）。上述學者所要提醒心理學界的主要用意，在於表達過去心

理學研究是透過一個人口數佔比不夠多且代表性不夠周全的研究取樣所得的成果，用此

等結果來理解全世界人類的心理現象恐有所偏頗，就心理學的生理層面而言，不同人種

的生理心理表現已有所別，就心理學的文化層面而言，則不同地區人們的文化心理意涵

則差異更大。心理學對文化層面的重視宜更被強調。

雖然有樣本代表性不足的問題，現代心理學的過去研究成果仍是不容否定，不過，

上述以全球性人們為對象來思考心理學的適切性確實是很有意義的，特別是對不同地區

人們心理學文化層面的關注，可望對現代心理學的未來發展提供了很好的反思與檢討的

方向。特別是有學者即明白指出：「心理學必須面對一個新的現實，那就是非西方心理

學的覺醒，這是基於每一個文化，無論是東方或西方，都有其獨特的心理學適切性，並

vii

與其歷史與文化的根源具有一致性」(Marsella & Pickren, 2012, p. ix)。也就是心理學不能

脫離其歷史與文化，此等觀點對非西方的心理學家來說，更是具有非常重要的提示與警

醒之意：非西方心理學家應該考量其所在地區所的獨特心理學適切性，注意其歷史與文

化根源對心理學的影響，此等觀照與反思即是心理學本土化的初衷，也是心理學本土化

所要探索的內涵與方向。

貳、心理學的本土化思潮

心理學的本土化運動最早起自 1970 年代末期，在全世界的不同地區陸續有許多心

理學家開始不約而同的倡議心理學本土化議題，這些心理學家主要是來自於非西方的國

家，比如：墨西哥、韓國、日本、菲律賓、印度、波蘭以及台灣，此一運動的初期並未

受到太多的關注，直至 1990 年代，才開始受到主流心理學界的重視，以及不以為然的

批評（黃光國，2004；Hwang, 2005），在台灣倡議本土心理學最著名的學者首推台大心

理系的楊國樞教授與黃光國教授，兩位學者的本土化觀點也持續影響台灣本土心理學的

發展（王智弘，2014）。台灣心理學本土化運動起自於台灣北部的台灣大學，後續的發

展則擴及中南部與東部的大學院校，包括中部的彰化師大、南部的高雄師大、高雄醫大

以及東部的東華大學與慈濟大學等，並在諮商心理學領域引起更廣泛的影響，而就歷史

上的發展脈絡來看，台灣的心理學本土化運動原屬於台灣社會科學本土化運動的一環。

          台灣社會科學本土化運動濫觴於社會科學研究中國化的倡議，起於 1980 年楊國

樞與文崇一在中央研究院民(cid:13687)學研究所策畫召開的「社會及行為科學研究的中國化科際

研討會」，研討會的召開及論文集「社會及行為科學研究的中國化」的出版，引發了社

會科學界的重視與討論（楊國樞，1993；楊國樞、文崇一，1982；蕭全政，2000）。這

無可否認的是華人社會科學研究本土化運動的一個重要里程碑，其中深刻反映出學界對

社會科學受西方影響的反省，起而倡議「社會及行為科學中國化」的議題。不過在經歷

多年政治、經濟、社會、文化與研究理念上的轉變，「中國化」已逐漸定調於「本土化」

的用語與研究取向（楊國樞，1993；蕭全政，2000），而在研究主題與研究方法上有更

為寬廣的視野，「本土化」的用語與概念也可適用於亞洲與全世界。

  台灣社會科學本土化運動發展最蓬勃的學術領域是本土心理學，而本土心理學的發

展也啟發了本土諮商心理學之發展，心理諮商研究也致力於如何契合華人文化的理論建

viii

構與方法設計，而有系統與深入的探討華人心理療癒之道（王智弘，2014），在黃光國

（2011，2018）主張：善用含攝文化（culture-inclusive）的研究理路（所謂含攝，指的

是包容、包含之意，含攝文化即是要包含文化、納入文化），並依循文化心理學「一種

心智，多種心態；普世主義，考量分殊」（one mind, many mentalities; universalism without

uniformity）的原則（黃光國，2011；Shweder, et al., 1998），以建構(cid:13706)能代表普世的人

類心智，又能表現特定文化人群的特殊心態之本土諮商心理學理論與技術。

參、諮商心理學的本土化內涵

  所謂的「本土化」，簡單的來說，所謂的「本」是文化傳統、所謂的「土」是在地

生活經驗，諮商心理學「本土化」過程即是將外地引入的現代諮商心理學理論與技術，

與本地文化傳統的「本」和在地生活經驗的「土」相結合，以創建出本土諮商心理學的

理論與研究成果，而能更適用於本地人身上（王智弘，2016，2017；王智弘等，2017）。

        透過心理諮商的本土化，而能將現代心理諮商專業與在地的文化傳統與生活經驗相

結合，所得的本土諮商心理學理論將能更運用於對在地人們心理狀況的了解與心理問題

的解決。因此，本土化(cid:13706)不是簡單的只是將外來諮商心理學理論進行在地化，也不是對

傳統文化加以現代化應用，而是要走出東西方文化的會通與創新之路（王智弘，2017）。

因為相較於西方偏重的個人主義文化，對照出東方偏重的關係主義文化；相較於西方的

個人化性格變項，對應出東方的脈絡化性格變項（黃光國，2009；葉光輝，2017；Hwang,

2012）。如何將東西方的文化智慧與現代諮商心理學專業知識相結合，並以在地的生活

經驗為處境，透過「本土社會科學創造詮釋學」的研究程序，進行創造性的理論建構，

以建構出可以描繪在地人們「生活世界」的諮商心理學「科學微世界」（華爾納、沈清

松，2018），建立本土諮商心理學的理論建構，正是本土諮商心理學的努力目標。

肆、本土諮商心理學的研究方法論

  而與上述本土化研究方向相應的本土化理論建構之步驟有三（王智弘，2014，2017，

2023；王智弘等，2017；黃光國，2009，2018；Hwang, 2012）：一、理念探索：以本地

文化傳統智慧為題材，並以西方科學哲學知識論為基礎，選擇合適的文化內容與研究方

ix

法進行本土化研究；二、理論建構：進行(cid:13706)能代表普世心智，又能代表本地文化心態（黃

光國，2011；Shweder et al., 1998）的本土化理論建構；三、研究驗證：進行能驗證本土

化理論的實徵研究，以確認其學術與實務應用價值。在上述的本土化研究方向與本土化

理論建構步驟中，有兩個重要的核心議題即是如何借鏡與創造性取用本土文化歷史中的

傳統智慧與文化概念，而又如何運用西方科學哲學知識論以作為本土化理論建構的研究

方法論，也就是要建立能會通本土文化與外在文化，以及能會通跨學科與跨領域知識的

研究方法論與知識論基礎。而要回應此等本土化理論建構之核心議題，則可考慮運用「實

謂」、「意謂」、「蘊謂」、「當謂」、「必謂」與「轉謂」之六層本土社會科學創造

詮釋學（王智弘，2019，2020，2023；傅偉勳，1986，1999）以及結合「建構實在論（華

爾納、沈清松，2018）、「結構主義」（Piaget, 1968/2018）」與「批判實在論」（Bhaskar,

2008）的含攝文化知識論策略（黃光國，2018；Hwang, 2019）以為研究策略。

  結合本土社會科學創造詮釋學與含攝文化知識論策略可做為本土化理論建構的方

法論，並透過前述三階段的本土化理論建構研究步驟加以展開（王智弘，2014，2017，

2023；王智弘等，2017；黃光國，2009，2018；Hwang, 2012）：（1）理念探索（對所

欲研究的對象以及傳統文化智慧進行選擇）：藉由善用東方哲學中傳統智慧為題材（比

如：儒釋道文化傳統）透過本土社會科學創造詮釋學進行創造性詮釋，並以西方社會科

學與諮商心理學理論，以及科學哲學的知識論（建構含攝文化理論的知識論策略/科學發

現的邏輯）為基礎，巧妙地選擇合適的文化內容與研究方法進行社會科學或諮商心理學

本土化研究，進行轉謂層次的跨文化會通與跨領域會通之理念探索，以完成理論建構的

內容基礎；（2）理論建構：運用結構主義與建構實在論的觀點以進行模型建構，以建立

科學微世界對生活世界的關連與描述，而進行(cid:13706)能代表普世心智，又能代表本土文化心

態（黃光國，2011；Shweder et al., 1998）的社會科學或諮商心理學本土化之理論建構，

而完成批判實在論的創生性「機制」之建立；（3）研究驗證：進行能驗證社會科學或諮

商心理學本土化理論的實徵研究以進行批判實在論的經驗驗證，以確立先驗實在論的創

生性「機制」之真實性，而確認社會科學或諮商心理學本土化理論之學術與實務應用價

值。

伍、本土諮商心理學研究發展中心與本土諮商心理學學刊的使命

x

  距離威廉·馮德創建心理學實驗室的 136 年後，2015 年 11 月 5 日，彰化師範大學輔

導與諮商學系本土諮商心理學研究發展中心設置辦法通過，也在輔導與諮商學系系館三

樓的小房間裏，成立本土諮商心理學研究發展中心（王智弘，2015），宣告本土諮商心

理學研究的新時代來臨，《道德經》有言：「九層之臺起於給累土；千里之行始於足下」

〈六十四章〉，心理諮商本土化已是必然的發展趨勢，此一中心的成立，旨在推動本土

諮商心理學之學術發展、實務推廣與國際交流（國立彰化師範大學輔導與諮商學系本土

諮商心理學發展中心設置辦法，2015），藉此與全世界有志於本土諮商心理學的學者與

實務工作者共同努力，為諮商心理學的未來發展貢獻一份心力，2017 年 3 月起，彰化師

範大學輔導與諮商學系原發行的「台灣心理諮商季刊」也改名為「本土諮商心理學學刊」，

在改名創刊之際，本土諮商心理學刊也提醒本土諮商心理學的研究者並須面對四個課題

的考驗（王智弘，2017）：1.理解的課題：對本土文化與諮商專業的理解是否充分；2.實

踐的課題：對本土文化與諮商專業的實踐是否到位；3.驗證的課題：對本土化諮商理論

的理論建構是否完備；以及目標的課題：對本土化諮商理論的本土化目標是否達成。而

本土化諮商理論的理論建構主要在推動三種類型的本土化研究（王智弘，2016）：1.在

地 化 的 本 土 化 （ localizative  indigenization ） ； 2. 文 化 融 合 的 本 土 化 （ acculturative

indigenization）；以及 3.  文化繼承的本土化（enculturative indigenization）。並引用林安

梧（2016）做學問「五證」的觀點：1.歷史的考證；2.典籍的佐證；3.科學的驗證；4.邏

輯的辯證；以及 5.心性的體證，特別強調「心性的體證」是東方文化的特色，期待本土

化學者需有個人自我成長的心性體證，所建構的理論才是真學問，也就是「內聖、外王」

之道，聖者善也、王者用也。

        本土諮商心理學研究發展中心除了一年四期發行「本土諮商心理學學刊」之外，也

舉辦本土諮商心理學的國際學術研討會，自 2016 年與台灣輔導與諮商學會在日月潭共

同舉辦第一屆的本土諮商心理學國際學術研討會之後，自 2018 年起即每年與中華本土

社會科學會（http://cissa.heart.net.tw/）共同舉辦本土社會科學與本土諮商心理學國際學

術研討會，今年已邁入第八屆－「第七屆社會科學本土化學術研討會暨第八屆本土諮商

心理學學術研討會」，預定於 2024 年 10 月  31 日（星期四）到  11 月  2 日（星期六）

於台北市的中央研究院民(cid:13687)學研究所舉行。

陸、本土諮商心理學學刊發行中英雙語全文版本的用意

xi

本土諮商心理學學刊發行的目的在推動本土諮商心理學的學術與實務研究，並以跨

文化、跨領域學刊的精神，除以發表輔導、諮商心理、臨床心理、復健諮商、社會工作、

精神醫學、精神護理、心理衛生、職能治療、語言治療、特殊教育、員工協助方案等與

心理學及助人專業相關學科之本土化專論為主，並基於鼓勵本土化研究的立場，本學刊

也接受跨領域的本土化社會科學研究論文的發表，本學刊的基本語言是中文，雖然中文

已是世界上最多人使用的語言，但考慮讓更多讀者能夠閱讀到本土社會科學與本土諮商

心理學的研究成果，考量英文是第二多人口使用的語言（世界語言，2024 年 3 月 25 日），

而且在國際學術交流上的使用非常普及，因此，本學刊除了同時接受中文與英文兩種語

言論文的投稿之外，自第十五卷開始（2024 年 3 月）更進一步將接受刊登的論文採中、

英文雙語全文刊登的方式出版，亦即無論以中文投稿或是英文投稿，審查完成刊登時都

將以雙語全文方式刊登，此等出刊方式經過去年 14 卷第 3 期（2023 年 9 月）開始試辦

兩期後，獲得國內外學術界許多正面的迴響，因此，本刊確定從本年度（2024 年）與本

期（15 卷第１期）開始，正式推出中、英雙語全文版，為迎接此一具有挑戰性的新出刊

任務，本刊也正式邀請具有中英文翻譯專業背景的嚴嘉琪主編加入編輯團隊，嚴主編為

美國印第安那大學（Bloomington）課程與教學博士，現任國立臺中科技大學應用英語系

教授，歷任國際長、語文學院副院長、應用英語系主任、語言中心主任與諮商輔導組組

長，具有跨領域的學術專長。本刊感謝嚴主編的加入也感謝編輯委員會所有編輯委員與

國立彰化師範大學的長期支持，也希望有志於推動社會科學、心理學與諮商心理學本土

化的各國學者能給予支持與賜稿，讓本刊能不斷的進步與成長，而對亞洲與全世界的學

術本土化運動做出更多的貢獻。

本期刊登了四篇本土化研究，第一篇是李仁豪（2024）所撰寫的「陰陽孝道論」，

探討華人的孝道非僅在父母生前有之，在父母過世後依舊是影響著子女與後代；第二篇

是陳復（2024）所撰寫的「從大學生命教育的角度來認識具象思維與教學態度」，探討

在社會變遷下大學的生命教育如何有新的教學思維與態度；第三篇是李蓉蓉等（2024）

所撰寫的「從榮格取向表達性藝術治療論一位本土重鬱症女性離苦得樂之經驗」，探討

以沙盤為主要媒材的榮格取向表達性藝術治療憂鬱症當事人的經驗；第四篇是蔡雨澤與

方嘉琦（2024）所撰寫「台灣校園多元性別(cid:13687)群學生遭遇恐同經驗之探究」，探討在台

灣同志學生從小學到大學校園中所遭遇的恐同經驗。四篇論文都具有本土化研究的特色，

也都深具思維與內涵，相當值得讀者好好加以欣賞。

Indigenous Root and International Connect：The Context Behind the
Launch of a Bilingual Full-Text Version in Chinese and English of the
Journal of Indigenous Counseling Psychology

Chih-Hung Wang＊  Jia-Chyi Yan

Abstract

After more than a century of development in modern psychology, the initiative to develop

indigenous counseling psychology emerged.  Indigenous counseling psychology, as a part of

indigenous social sciences and indigenous psychology, has led to the inception of the Journal

of  Indigenous  Counseling  Psychology.    Published  by  the  Center  for  Indigenous  Counseling

Psychology  at  National  Changhua  University  of  Education,  this  academic  journal  aims  to

promote  academic  and  practical  research  in  indigenous  counseling  psychology  and  related

fields. It publishes articles focusing on guidance, counseling psychology, clinical psychology,

rehabilitation counseling, social work, psychiatry, mental nursing, mental health, occupational

therapy,  speech  therapy,  special  education,  employee  assistance  programs,  and  other

indigenous monographs related to psychology and helping professions. Based on encouraging

indigenous research, this journal accepts cross-field indigenous social science research papers.

The  primary  language  is  Chinese.  Although  Chinese  is  the  most  spoken  language  in  the

worldwide,  the  journal  has  decided  to  publish  in  both  Chinese  and  English,  allowing  more

readers to access papers on indigenous social sciences and counseling psychology. According

to the World Language report on March 25, 2024, English is the second most spoken language

in the world and is widely used in international academic exchanges. Therefore, this journal

accepts submissions in Chinese and English, starting from the fifteenth volume (March 2024);

accepted papers will be published in a bilingual Chinese-English full-text format, regardless of

the original submission language. This publishing policy has received positive feedback from

domestic and international academic circles after two trial issues started in Volume 14, Issue 3

xv

(September 2023) last year. Therefore, this journal will officially launch a bilingual full-text

version in Chinese and English this year (2024) and this issue (Volume 15, Issue 1). Editor-in-

Chief Jia-Chyi Yan, with professional Chinese-English translation experience, has joined the

editorial team. Dr. Yan holds a Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction from Indiana University

Bloomington and is currently a professor in the Department of Applied English at the National

Taichung University of Science and Technology. With cross-field academic expertise, she has

served successively as Director of the International Affairs Office, Vice Dean of the College of

Languages, Director of the Department of Applied English, Director of the Language Center,

and Leader of the Student Counseling Center. This journal would like to thank Editor-in-Chief

Yan  for  joining  us,  as  well  as  all  members  of  the  editorial  board  and  National  Changhua

University  of  Education  for  their  long-term  support.  We  hope  that  scholars  worldwide

interested  in  promoting  the  indigenization  of  social  sciences,  psychology,  and  psychology

counseling  will  support  and  submit  manuscripts  to  propel  this  journal’s  progress  and

contributions    to the academic indigenization movement across Asia and worldwide.

I. From Physiological Psychology to Cultural Psychology

The origin of modern psychology is often mentioned as being in December 1879, when

the German physiologist Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (1832-1920), in a small room on the third

floor  of  the  Konvikt  building  at  the  University  of  Leipzig,  created  the  first  Laboratory  of

Experimental  Psychology  of  the  world,  and  began  the  development  of  modern  psychology,

Wundt was also the first person to call himself a “psychologist.” Among his life works were

two well-known books, one of which was “Principles of Physiological Psychology,” published

when he was 42 years old. This book is the pioneering work of modern psychology; the second

is the ten volumes published when he passed away at the age of 88 and took 20 years to write.

Masterpiece: “Ethnopsychology”. Throughout Wundt’s life, his psychological research began

by  focusing  on  the  physiological  aspects  of  individual  feelings  and  perceptions.  Finally,  it

focused on the group’s social, national, and other cultural aspects. This marked the professional

development  and  mental  journey  of  psychologists  and  also  demonstrated  the  diverse

implications  of the development of psychology (Wang, 2016b). The physiological  aspect  of

psychology  is  worthy  of  study,  and  the  cultural  aspect  of  psychology  cannot  be  ignored.

Psychology encompasses aspects from physiology to culture.

However, most psychological research over the past century has lacked a holistic view of

human culture. For example, Arnett (2008) pointed out that between 2003 and 2007, articles

published in major journals in the six major fields of psychology, 68% of the research subjects

came from the United States. Even if the cumulative proportion of research subjects reached

96%, they are only from Western industrialized countries (Europe, North America, Australia,

or  Israel).  No  wonder  some  scholars  have  reminded  that  the  development  of  Western

psychological  theories  in  the  past  may  have  been  based  on  the  psychological  research  of  a

WEIRD sample: the so-called WEIRD refers to Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and

Democratic (Henrich et al., 2010a, 2010b; Hwang, 2012). The main intention of the scholars

mentioned above is to remind the psychology community that the sampling representativeness

of past psychological results is not comprehensive enough, and using these results to understand

the  psychological  phenomena  of  human  beings  around  the  world  may  be  biased.  From  a

physiological level, people in different regions have different psychological performances due

to  physiological  differences.  From  a  cultural  level,  people  from  different  areas  have  more

different psychological performances due to cultural differences. In other words, psychology

should place more emphasis on cultural dimensions.

xvii

Although there is a problem of insufficient sample representation, the past research results

of  modern  psychology  cannot  be  denied.  However,  the  consideration  mentioned  above  of

psychology's applicability to people around the world is indeed significant. In particular, the

focus on the cultural aspects of people's psychology in different regions is expected to provide

a good direction for reflecting on and reviewing the future development of modern psychology.

Some scholars clearly pointed out: "The awakening of non-Western psychology to the reality

that  every  culture  -  East  or  West  -  evolves  its  own  unique  psychologies  appropriate  to  and

consistent with their historical and cultural roots is the new reality in psychology” (Marsella &

Pickren, 2012, p. ix). That is to say, psychology cannot be separated from its history and culture.

These views are crucial reminders and warnings for non-Western psychologists: non-Western

psychologists should consider the unique psychology of their regions. Study appropriateness

and  pay  attention  to  the  impact  of  its  historical  and  cultural  roots  on  psychology.  This

observation and reflection are the original intention of the indigenization of psychology and the

connotation and direction to be explored in the indigenization of psychology.

II. The Indigenization Trend of Psychology

The  indigenization  movement  in  psychology  first  emerged  in  the  late  1970s.  Many

psychologists  in  different  regions  worldwide  began  to  advocate  the  indigenization  of

psychology.  These  psychologists  are  mainly  from  non-Western  countries,  such  as  Mexico,

South  Korea,  Japan,  Philippines,  India,  Poland,  and  Taiwan;  this  movement  did  not  receive

much attention in the early stages. It was not until the 1990s that it began to receive attention

from the mainstream psychology community, as well as disapproval criticism (Huang, 2004,

2005). Professor Kuo-Shu Yang  and Professor Kwang-Kuo  Hwang from  the Department  of

Psychology  of  National  Taiwan  University  are  the  most  famous  scholars  who  advocated

indigenous psychology in Taiwan. The indigenization views of these two scholars also continue

to  influence  the  development  of  indigenous  psychology  in  Taiwan  (Wang,  2014).  The

indigenization  movement  of  psychology  in  Taiwan  originated  at  the  National  Taiwan

University in northern Taiwan. Subsequently, it expanded to universities in the central, southern,

and eastern parts of Taiwan, including the National Changhua University of Education in the

central part, National Kaohsiung Normal University and Kaohsiung Medical University are in

the southern part, and National Donghua University and Tzu Chi University are in the eastern

part etc., and have caused a wider impact in the field of counseling psychology. Historically,

xviii

Taiwan’s  psychology  indigenization  movement  stemmed  from  its  broader  indigenous  social

science movement.

Taiwan’s social science indigenization movement originated from the initiative to sinicize

social  science  research.  It  began  in  1980  with  the  “Interdisciplinary  Symposium  on  the

Sinicization of Social and Behavioral Science Research” planned and held by Kuo-Shu Yang

and  Chung-I  Wen  at  the  Institute  of  Ethnology,  Academia  Sinica,  the  convening  of  the

symposium  and  the  publication  of  the  collection  of  papers  "The  Sinicization  of  Social  and

Behavioral Science Research in China" aroused attention and discussion in the social science

community (Shiau, 2000; Yang, 1993; Yang & Wen, 1982). This is undeniably an important

milestone  in  the  indigenization  movement  of  Chinese  social  science  research.  It  profoundly

reflects the academic community’s reflection on the influence of the West on social sciences

and has initiated the issue of “Sinicization of social and behavioral sciences.” However, after

years of changes in politics, economy, society, culture, and research concepts, "Sinicization"

has gradually settled on the terminology and research orientation of "indigenization" (Shiau,

2000; Yang, 1993), and in the research topic with a broader vision and research methods, the

terminology and concept of "indigenization" can also be applied to Asia and the world.

The most prosperous academic field in Taiwan's social science indigenization movement

is indigenous psychology, and the development of indigenous psychology has also inspired the

development  of  indigenous  counseling  psychology.  Research  on  indigenous  counseling

psychology  is  also  devoted  to  fitting  in  with  Chinese  culture,  developing  theoretical

construction  and  method  design,  and  exploring  Chinese  psychological  healing  methods  in-

depth and systematically (Wang, 2014). Hwang (2011, 2018) advocated making good use of

the  culture-inclusive  research  theory  (the  so-called  inclusive,  refers  to  It  means  inclusive,

inclusive, and culture-inclusive means to include culture and incorporate culture) and following

the  principle  of  cultural  psychology,  "one  mind,  many  mentalities;  universalism  without

uniformity" (Huang, 2011; Shweder et al., 1998), to construct the theories and techniques of

indigenous counseling psychology that can not only represent the universal human mind but

also express the specific mentality of particular cultural groups.

III. The Indigenization Connotation of Counseling Psychology

        To put it simply, the so-called "Indigenization"(「本土化」), combines elements of cultural

"origin" and local "land." The "origin"(「本」) refers to cultural traditions, while the "land"

xix

(「土」)refers to local life experiences. The    "indigenization"(「本土化」-Tracing back to the

origin of culture and matching to the life experience of local land ) of counseling psychology is

the process of combining modern theories of counseling psychology (from other places) with

cultural  tradition  ( the  "origin" of  culture) and local  experience (the life experience of local

"land" )to create theories of indigenous counseling psychology that are more applicable to local

people (Wang, 2016a, 2017; Wang et al., 2017).

Modern  counseling  professions  can  be  combined  with  local  cultural  traditions  and  life

experiences  through  the  Indigenization  of  counseling.  The  obtained  indigenous  counseling

psychology theory will be more applicable to understanding the psychological conditions  of

local people and the resolution of psychological problems. Therefore, Indigenization is neither

a simple localization of foreign counseling psychology theories nor a modern application of

traditional culture but a path of communication and innovation between Eastern and Western

cultures (Wang, 2017). Compared with the individualistic culture that is emphasized in the West,

it contrasts with the relationship-oriented culture that is noted in the East; compared with the

individualized  personality  variables  in  the  West,  it  corresponds  to  the  contextualized

personality variables in the East (Hwang, 2009, 2012; Yeh, 2017). How to combine the cultural

wisdom  of  the  East  and  the  West  with  the  professional  knowledge  of  modern  counseling

psychology  and  use  the  local  life  experience  as  the  context  to  carry  out  creative  theoretical

construction through the research process of "indigenous social science creative hermeneutics"

to construct developing a "scientific microworld" of counseling psychology that can describe

the  "life-world"  of  local  people  (Warner  &  Shen,  2018)  and  establishing  a  theoretical

construction  of  indigenous  counseling  psychology  are  precisely  the  goals  of  indigenous

counseling psychology.

IV. Research Methodology of Indigenous Counseling Psychology

There  are  three  steps  in  constructing  indigenous  theory  corresponding  to  the  above-

mentioned indigenization research directions (Hwang, 2009, 2012, 2018; Wang, 2014, 2017,

2023):  1.  Concept  exploration:  taking  the  traditional  wisdom  of  local  culture  as  the  subject

matter,  and  using  Western  based  on  the  epistemology  of  scientific  philosophy,  select

appropriate  cultural  content  and  research  methods  to  conduct  indigenous  research;  2.

Theoretical  construction:  conduct  research  representing  the  universal  mind  and  the  local

cultural  mentality  (Huang,  2011;  Shweder  et  al.,  1998  );  3.  Research  verification:  Conduct

xx

practical research that can verify the indigenous theory and confirm its academic and practical

application value. In the above-mentioned indigenous research directions and indigenous theory

construction  steps,  there  are  two  essential  core  issues:  how  to  borrow  and  creatively  use

traditional  wisdom  and  cultural  concepts  in  local  cultural  history  and  how  to  use  Western

scientific  philosophy  of  knowledge.  To  serve  as  a  research  methodology  for  indigenous

theoretical construction, it is necessary to establish a research methodology and epistemological

foundation that can integrate local culture and external culture, as well as interdisciplinary and

cross-field knowledge. To respond to these core issues of indigenous theoretical construction,

we can consider using the six levels of dialectical interpretation of “Indigenous Social Science

Creative Hermeneutics”: text, meaning, connotation, refinement, creation, and transformation

(Fu,  1986,  1999;  Wang,  2019,  2020,  2023)  and  “Epistemological  Strategy  for  Constructing

Culture-Inclusive Theories” (Hwang, 2018, 2019), combining "Constructive Realism” (Warner

& Shen, 2018), “Structuralism” (Piaget, 1968/2018)” and “Critical Realism” (Bhaskar, 2008).

Combining  "Indigenous  Social  Science  Creative  Hermeneutics"  and  "Epistemological

Strategy for Constructing Culture-Inclusive Theories" serves as a methodology for indigenous

theory construction, and to be carried out through the following three stages: (Hwang, 2009,

2012 , 2018; Wang, 2014, 2017, 2023; Wang et al., 2017): (1) Concept exploration (selecting

the object of study and traditional cultural wisdom): By making good use of traditional wisdom

in Eastern philosophy as the subject matter (such as : Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism

cultural  traditions)  are  creatively  interpreted  through  Indigenous  Social  Science  Creative

Hermeneutics,  and  based  on  Western  social  science  and  counseling  psychology  theories,  as

well as the epistemology of scientific philosophy (Epistemological Strategy for Constructing

Culture-Inclusive  Theories/The  Logic  of  Scientific  Discovery)  as  the  basis,  skillfully  select

appropriate  cultural  content  and  research  methods  to  conduct  indigenous  research  in  social

sciences or counseling psychology, and explore the concept of cross-cultural communication

and  cross-field  communication  at  the  transfer  level  to  lay  the  conceptual  foundation  for

theoretical  construction. Content basis; (2) Theoretical construction: Use the perspectives of

"Structuralism" and "Constructive Realism" to construct models to establish the connection and

description of the scientific microworld to the living world and to conduct model construction

that can represent both the universal mind and the theoretical construction of the indigenization

of local cultural mentality (Huang, 2011; Shweder et al., 1998) in social sciences or counseling

psychology,  and  the  establishment  of  the  creative  "mechanism"  of  "Critical  Realism";  (3)

Research  verification:  Conduct  empirical  research  that  can  verify  the  indigenous  theory  of

social science or counseling psychology to conduct empirical verification of "Critical Realism"

xxi

to  establish  the  authenticity  of  the  creative  "mechanism"  of  "Transcendental  Realism"  and

confirm the academic and practical application value of indigenous social science or indigenous

counseling psychology theory.

V. The Mission of the Center for Indigenous Counseling Psychology and the Journal of

Indigenous Counseling Psychology

136  years  after  Wilhelm  Maximilian  Wundt  founded  the  Laboratory  of  Experimental

Psychology, on November 5, 2015, the regulations for establishing the Center for Indigenous

Counseling Psychology of the Department of Guidance and Counseling, National Changhua

University of Education, were passed.  In a small  room on the third floor of the Department

building,  the  Center  for  Indigenous  Counseling  Psychology  was  established  (Wang,  2015),

marking a new chapter for indigenous counseling psychology research. The "Tao Te Ching"

says: “The nine-story platform rises from a basket of soil. The thousand-mile journey begins

with a single step" (Chapter 64). The indigenization of counseling psychology is an inevitable

development trend. The establishment of this center aims to promote the academic development,

practical promotion, and internationalization of indigenous counseling psychology (Regulation

for  the  Establishment  of  the  Center  for  Indigenous  Counseling  Psychology,  Department  of

Guidance and Counseling, National Changhua University of Education, 2015), through which

we  can  work  together  with  scholars  and  practitioners  worldwide  interested  in  indigenous

counseling  psychology.  To  contribute  to  the  future  development  of  indigenous  counseling

psychology, the "Taiwan Counseling Quarterly," originally published by the Department, has

also  been  renamed  "The  Journal  of  Indigenous  Counseling  Psychology."  The  Journal  also

reminds researchers of indigenous counseling psychology that they must face the test of four

issues (Wang, 2017): 1. Understanding issue: whether the understanding of local culture and

the counseling profession is sufficient; 2. Practice issue: whether the practice of local culture

and counseling profession is in place; 3. Verification issue: whether the theoretical construction

of  indigenous  counseling  psychology    is  complete;  and  4.Target  issue:  whether  the  goal  of

indigenization  of  counseling  psychology  theory  is  achieved.  The  theoretical  construction  of

indigenous  counseling  psychology  mainly  promotes  three  types  of  indigenization  research

(Wang,  2016a):  1.  localizative  indigenization;  2.  acculturative  indigenization;  and  3.

xxii

enculturative indigenization. The Journal also cited Lin (2016)’s view of the “five proofs” of

learning: 1. Historical research; 2. Evidence from classics; 3. Scientific verification; 4. Logical

dialectics; and 5. Demonstration of the mind’s nature. With special emphasis on "Realization

of the nature of mind" is a characteristic of Eastern culture. It is expected that local scholars

must have the experience of personal self-growth and the theory constructed is true knowledge,

which is the way of "inner sage and outer king". The sage means being virtuous, the king means

practical application.

In addition to publishing the "Journal of Indigenous Counseling Psychology" four times a

year, the Center for Indigenous Counseling Psychology also organizes international academic

seminars on Indigenous Counseling Psychology. Since 2016, it has cooperated with the Taiwan

Guidance and Counseling Association co-organized the first international academic symposium

on indigenous counseling psychology at Sun Moon Lake. Then, the center was co-organized

with the Chinese Indigenous Social Science Association to hold the International Indigenous

Social Science Conference and Indigenous Counseling Psychology Conference for six years at

the National Changhua University of Education. This year, the title of the conference is " The

Seventh  International  Indigenous  Social  Science  Conference  and  the  Eighth  Indigenous

Counseling  Psychology  Conference,  "scheduled  to  be  held  from  October  31(Thursday)  to

November 2 (Saturday), 2024. It will be held at the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica,

Taipei, Taiwan.

VI. The Purpose of Publishing a Chinese-English Bilingual Full-Text Version of Journal

of Indigenous Counseling Psychology

The purpose of the Journal of Indigenous Counseling Psychology is to promote academic

and practical research in indigenous counseling psychology. This journal publishes guidance,

counseling psychology, clinical psychology, rehabilitation counseling, social work, psychiatry,

mental  nursing,  mental  health,  occupational  therapy,  speech  therapy,  special  education,

employee assistance programs,  and other indigenous monographs  related to  psychology and

helping professions. Based on encouraging indigenous research, this journal also accepts cross-

field  indigenous  social science  research papers.  The primary language is Chinese. Although

Chinese  is  the  most  spoken  language  worldwide,  we  aim  to  allow  more  readers  access  to

indigenous social science and counseling psychology research. According to the report (World

Language, March 25, 2024), English is the second most widely used language and prevalent in

xxiii

international academic exchanges. Therefore, this journal accepts submissions in Chinese and

English. Starting from the fifteenth volume (March 2024); accepted papers will be published in

a bilingual  Chinese-English  full-text format, regardless  of the original submission  language.

This  publishing  policy  has  received  positive  feedback  from  domestic  and  international

academic circles after two trial issues started in Volume 14, Issue 3 (September 2023) last year.

Therefore, this journal will officially launch a bilingual full-text version in Chinese and English

this  year  (2024)  and  this  issue  (Volume  15,  Issue  1).  Editor-in-Chief  Jia-Chyi  Yan,  with

professional  Chinese-English  translation  experience,  has  joined  the  editorial  team.  Dr.  Yan

holds  a  Ph.D.  in  Curriculum  and  Instruction  from  Indiana  University  Bloomington  and  is

currently a professor in the Department of Applied English at the National Taichung University

of Science and Technology. With cross-field academic expertise, she has served successively

as Director of the International Affairs Office, Vice Dean of the College of Languages, Director

of  the  Department  of  Applied  English,  Director  of  the  Language  Center,  and  Leader  of  the

Student Counseling Center. We thank Editor-in-Chief Yan for joining, as well as all members

of  the  editorial  board  and  National  Changhua  University  of  Education  for  their  long-term

support.  We  hope  scholars  worldwide  interested  in  promoting  the  indigenization  of  social

sciences, psychology, and counseling psychology will support and contribute manuscripts to

propel  this  journal’s  progress  and  contributions  to  the  academic  indigenization  movement

across Asia and worldwide.

  This issue publishes four localized studies. The first is "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory"

written by Jen-Hao Li (2024), which explores how Chinese filial piety is not only present during

the parents' lifetime but  also continues after the parents' death.  It  affects  children and future

generations;  the  second  article  is  "The  Embodied  Thinking  and  Teaching  Manner  of  Life

Education  at  University,"  written  by  Fu  Chen  (2024),  which  explores  how  life  education  in

universities can have new teaching thinking and attitudes under social changes; the third article

is  "On  Freedom  from  Suffering:  A  Jungian  Expressive  Art  Therapy  Analysis  of  A  Major

Depressive  Indigenous  Woman"  written  by  Jung-Jung  Li  et  al.  (2024),  which  explores  the

experience of Jungian expressive art using the sand table as the main medium to treat patients

with  depression;  the  fourth  article  is  "  An  Exploration  of  the  Homophobic  Experiences  of

LGBTQ+ Students in Taiwan Campuses " written by Yu-Tse Tsai and Chia-Chi Fang (2024),

which explores the homophobic experiences encountered by Tongzhi (LGBTQ+) students from

elementary  school  to  university  campuses  in  Taiwan.  The  four  papers  all  have  the

characteristics of indigenous research and are full of deep thinking and connotation. They are

well worth reading and appreciation by readers.

陰陽孝道論

李仁豪*

摘要

本研究遵循「一種心智，多重心態」原則，採雙重普世進路（先驗普世性和實徵普

世性），以陰陽論做為形上預設和先驗形式結構，建構一套普世暨含攝文化理論〈陰陽

孝道論〉。茲以喪親為關鍵事件，將孝道分為「陽孝」和「陰孝」。陽孝指父母在世時

子女盡的孝道；陰孝指喪親後子女盡的孝道。這裡視「生死」為陰陽，生為陽，死則陰；

生死特性符合陰陽互根、互斥、消長、轉化原理。孝道研究普遍未考量陰孝，是一大缺

憾；本理論彌補使之完備。依菲斯克（Alan Fiske）研究成果，普世人際互動關係有群己

共享、權威位階、平等匹配、市場計價四種。前兩者可運用在親人關係，本理論採用之

遂成兩大孝道先驗範疇「群己共享孝道」和「權威位階孝道」。孝道經由喪親而陰陽轉

化。在陽孝，群己共享孝道因我群偏愛、互惠利他而偏正向效果，權威位階孝道因地位

尊卑、資源施受而衍生負向效果。喪親後（陰孝），群己共享孝道會因失落、歉疚由正

轉負，權威位階孝道則藉由解放和補償由負轉正。本理論可統整以往孝道研究和喪親研

究有關正、負向效果之分歧結果，並深化孝道概念，拓展孝道和喪親研究領域，希冀對

本土社會科學（尤指本土諮商心理學）有所貢獻。

關鍵詞：群己共享孝道、陰孝、陽孝、喪親、雙重普世進路、權威位階孝道

壹、緒論

  尊崇孝道是華人文化特色，影響層面極深極廣，是本土社會科學重要議題（呂妙芬，

2011；葉光輝、楊國樞，2008）。孝道強調關係、脈絡、互動、歷程等面相（process-relational

perspective），此為東方文化及傳統哲學的特色和核心概念，其與西方文化及主流科學

的靜態實體觀（substance perspective）和方法論個人主義（methodological individualism）

大異其趣。唯與近代物理學相對論和量子論隱含的形上預設或本體論不謀而合，其揭示

事物實在或社會實在（social reality）的深邃本質（Bedford & Yeh, 2020; Cheng, 2011），

而本體論是科學研究典範、方法論、知識論根基（李仁豪，2020）；因此，孝道不僅是

本土社會科學深具特色的研究議題，對於如何建立普世人類心理學，從本土化推向全球

化（globalization, Tsao & Yeh, 2019），或如何遵循「一種心智，多重心態；普世主義，

考量分疏」（one mind, many mentalities; universalism without uniformity）原則（Shweder

et al., 2007），以科學哲學為基礎，會通中西（黃光國，2011），孝道研究亦具有啟發作

用與重要地位。

  本土心理學孝道研究開拓者之一為楊國樞（1985）。他參考《四書》、《禮記》、

《孝經》和著名家訓等典籍，融合人文學者對孝道之相關論述，統整出孝道 15 項內涵

「敬愛雙親、奉養雙親、順從雙親、諫親以理、事親以禮、娛親以道、思慕親情、隨侍

在側、使親無憂、愛護自己、為親留後、繼承家業、顯揚親名、葬之以禮、祀之以禮」。

這為孝道研究奠定良好基礎。當前主要孝道理論之一〈雙元孝道模型〉（Bedford & Yeh,

2019; Yeh, 2003; Yeh & Bedford, 2003），即奠基於楊國樞建立的孝道具體規範。儘管該

理論廣被接受、引用，仍有不盡完善處。本文提出〈陰陽孝道論〉與其競爭。依據費耶

本德（Paul  Feyerabend）多元主義方法論增生原則，即使某理論已經得到高度確認和普

遍接受，科學家也應該儘量發展其它理論，與其做良性競爭，以利科學發展。

  完善周延的科學研究必須蘊含哲學反思、理論建構和實徵研究。其中理論建構必須

滿足幾項規範或優劣判準：（1）完備性：指它能擴大解釋範圍或容納更多現象；（2）

整合性：研究結果彼此不一致乃至矛盾而產生謎題（puzzles），此為學術常態，科學社

群最關心如何解謎；理論必須提供一套架構或解釋，以便整合眾多分歧研究資料以解謎；

（3）內在一致性：理論內部各項命題或假定必須一致，不自相矛盾；（4）可驗證性：

這些命題可推演出假設，以便檢驗對錯；（5）蘊含歷史文化詮釋：依據哈伯瑪斯（Jürgen

Habermas）知識論，心理學(cid:13706)屬經驗分析學科，亦屬歷史詮釋學科，兼具兩種性格；然

而心理學界普遍忽略歷史詮釋成分，本土社會科學更應該重視這部分；（6）對稱性、簡

潔性乃至美感：這點雖非屬必要，但在判斷理論優劣時相當重要。特別是對稱性，它是

一項重要科學原理，諸多現象皆遵循對稱法則（Hargittai & Hargittai, 1994）。對稱性、

2

簡潔性衍生的美感，是許多科學家尋求自然法則的動力來源，愛因斯坦（Albert Einstein）

即是其中之一（Isaacson, 2007）。

  〈陰陽孝道論〉的完備性優於〈雙元孝道模型〉。絕大多數孝道研究都聚焦於父母

在世時子女盡的孝道，甚少提及喪親1後孝道。事實上，喪親後實踐的孝道成分不少，誠

如葉光輝（2005，293 頁）所言：「孝不僅僅指子女善養父母的這層意義而已，它範圍

逐漸加大擴大，例如繼述祖先之遺志也叫做孝，居父母之喪也稱為孝；因而，孝敬父母

並不限於父母在世，父母去世之後，也能持續」。可惜〈雙元孝道模型〉甚少著墨於此，

以致完備性略顯不足。觀諸楊國樞 15 項孝道具體內涵，其中父母在世實踐的孝道項目

有「諫親以理、事親以禮、娛親以道、使親無憂、隨侍在側、奉養雙親」等 6 項，可謂

「陽孝」。父母過世後實踐項目有「葬之以禮、祀之以禮」2 項，可謂「陰孝」。至於

其它 7 項「敬愛雙親、順從雙親、繼承家業、顯揚親名、思慕親情、愛護自己、為親留

後」，則不論父母生或死，皆可實踐，貫穿一生，故可稱為「終生孝」。由此可知，許

多孝道成分乃終其一生2，並非喪親後孝道就隨之終止，或僅祭祀追思而已。本理論涵蓋

陽孝和陰孝（兼具終生孝），其中陰孝之提出是本理論特色。

  心理學研究雖廣泛探討子女喪親後心理與行為，但多未關聯孝道。此外，喪親研究

結果相當分歧乃至矛盾，指喪親會同時對子女產生正、負向效果。譬如喪親增加子女的

疾病易感性，提高罹患憂鬱症、焦慮、無望感、自殺的念頭、企圖或行為，以及死亡機

率（Latham & Prigerson, 2004; Rostila & Saarela, 2011），這是負向效果。亦有研究指出

喪親帶來正向效果（Dahlberg, 2020;  Rostila & Saarela, 2011），例如喪親讓子女更成熟

（Davies, 1991），或領悟生命意義（Brewer & Sprakes, 2011）；智商高於 155 者早年喪

親比例三倍於預期值（Albert, 1971），或公認有所成就者（根據大英百科全書），早年

喪父比例大於預期值（Eisenstadt,  1978）。這是喪親研究謎題。孝道研究也類似。葉光

輝（2009）、Yeh（2003）整理分析，孝道會對子女產生以下正向效果，譬如有助於人

際互動的性格特質，如友善性、嚴謹性、和諧、人情等；促進親子間情感連結或家庭凝

聚力；減低親子衝突頻率；讓成年子女樂意給予雙親情感、金錢、勞務等方面支持等。

同時，孝道亦會對子女產生負向效果，例如使子女形成壓抑、服從、保守性格，或降低

心理彈性、創造力、自我表達能力，或父母孝道態度與子女認知複雜度負相關等。這是

孝道研究謎題。在〈陰陽孝道論〉架構下，當能解謎，統整喪親研究和孝道研究眾多不

一致結果。

  此外，喪親研究偏重子女的哀傷歷程、發展適應不良等方面，較少觸及更深層心境

轉化乃至生命蛻變的心理機制，即使有也幾乎未提及孝道，或提及孝道也僅輕輕帶過而

未深究。同時，亦較少從道德、宗教、文化等層面切入（如歉疚感、罪惡感、報恩心等

1  喪親有失去父母、手足或配偶。本文專指失去父母，含父親過世、母親過世、雙親俱歿三種情況。
2  15 項中占了 9 項之多。

3

道德感，或超越界、生死、苦難、覺悟等宗教信念）。譬如，Tang 與 Li（2019）探討中

國大學生在罹癌父母死後的心境歷程，發現四個主成分：（1）面臨生命鉅變，含負面反

應、否認並迴避死亡、生活秩序劇變三個副成分；（2）失落和悲慟經驗，含接受死亡事

實、深感不孝、失去至親強烈感受三個副成分；（3）喪親後生命挑戰和應對方式，含哀

傷孤獨感、失去工具性社會支持、失去情感性社會支持、應對策略四個副成分；（4）重

新理解死亡，含死亡合理化、賦予生命意義兩個副成分。內文僅兩處略提孝道。一個是

「深感不孝」，指出儒家文化規範易使子女（特別是兒子）產生強烈罪惡感。另一個是

「賦予生命意義」，指出儒家文化以孝道提供道德基礎，最終目的讓生命能善終圓滿。

這兩點實已點出「陰孝」核心概念，可惜內文未詳盡深入論述孝道，少歷史文化詮釋，

更未援引孝道理論統整說明。鑒於上述，本文希冀補喪親研究不足，從道德、宗教、文

化層面切入，著眼於喪親後子女心境轉化乃至生命蛻變等深層心理機制，嘗試連結孝道。

  〈陰陽孝道論〉可滿足上述提及完備性、整合性、蘊含歷史詮釋等理論規範，亦能

滿足內在一致性、可驗證性以及對稱性或簡潔性等諸多規範。

貳、方法論與本體論立場

一、宗教學不可知論和實效主義

  〈陰陽孝道論〉泰半涉及陰孝，蘊含宗教成分；但必須澄清，這些宗教概念（如業、

因果報應、來生、鬼神、上帝）僅是心理構念（psychological construct）。對於有無超越

界存在（客觀實存），本研究不作論斷。本質上，這是信仰層面問題，或屬道德實踐範

疇，屬「應然」，難以用「實然」科學方法檢驗。然而，持宗教信仰者相信超越界及其

運作機制確確實實存在，那種心理真實（psychological reality）能規約個人行動。因此，

宗教相關研究應如 Bellah（1970）建議，視之為象徵實在論（symbolic realism）。

  就方法學，Berger（1967）認為應當持方法學無神論（Methodological  Atheism）；

然 而 該 主 張有 不 少 問題 （ Porpora,  2006 ）， 改 持 方 法學 不 可 知論 （ Methodological

Agnosticism）可能更妥當（Smart, 1973）。若以實效主義（Pragmatism）觀點，則不必

追問「實相」究竟為何，但問其作用、功能或效益為何比較重要。譬如美國心理學之父

威廉．詹姆斯（James, 1902/2022）認為宗教目的並非神，而是生活，更廣大、更豐富、

更令人滿意的生活；抑或所謂「存在」就是製造差異，宗教信仰對象是否存在，端視祂

能否改變人（傅佩榮，2018）。依此，信與不信要看效果為何，這最重要，而有眾多研

究顯示宗教信仰對於心理健康和幸福感有正面益處（Levin, 2010）。

二、雙重普世進路

4

  針對「如何建構普世暨含攝文化理論」方法學難題，李仁豪（2023）基於黃光國所
提「先驗形式結構」3（transcendental formal structure）及「兩步驟知識論策略」（two-

step epistemological strategy）（Hwang, 2019），從哲學進路（新實在論、康德先驗哲學、

結構主義）和科學進路（演化論、知覺、認知和神經心理學）雙管齊下，提出「雙重普

世進路」，藉由失認症（以臉盲症為例）確認吾人認識事物（辨識物體）有兩個關鍵步

驟。（1）統覺辨識（apperceptive  recognition）：先有先驗形式結構，此較前階；（2）

聯結辨識（associative recognition）：將外界事物感覺質料，套入先驗形式結構，再聯結

至習得知識、記憶、名稱，產生意義，此較後階（Bruce & Young, 2012; Farah, 2004; Hole

& Bourne, 2010）。由此具認識論意涵的基本知覺認知歷程，轉至方法論，說明欲建構普

世暨含攝文化理論，得先建立「先驗普世性」（transcendental universality），爾後便能

透過文化具體內涵連結先驗形式結構，達到「實徵普世性」（empirical universality）。

先驗普世性可藉數、形、先驗範疇建立，實徵普世性則透過跨文化研究、發展研究、貫

時研究達成。另有比較心理學（comparative psychology）取徑，由此不僅可建立實徵普

世性，亦可連結先驗普世性。從演化角度找尋人類普世心智，不能單檢視人類，應對照

人類近親靈長類大猿（如黑猩猩、巴布諾猿、大猩猩、紅毛猩猩等）。譬如研究顯示，

識臉非人類獨有能力（先天、特化腦區、有別於其它物體辨識），許多動物（尤指靈長

類）亦如此（Pascalis & Kelly, 2009），這顯示識臉能力來自種系演化史（phylogenesis），

故具先驗普世性。

  先驗形式結構之「數」，不僅屬方法學，為量化研究基礎及憑據，更被認為是事物

實在自身或本源，如畢氏學派（Pythagoras school）主張「萬物皆數」。以「數」表徵或

建構現象界或實在界，始終是自然科學進路（Stewart, 1997）。「形」在自然現象和科學

理論裡亦非常重要（Hildebrandt & Tromba, 1985），且各種形狀或多面體各有其象徵意

義，亦具普世性（Lundy,  2002）。社會科學運用「形」的範例，如〈自我曼陀羅模型〉

採內圓外方（Hwang,  2011）和〈自性的心理動力模型〉採四方位體和八面體（Hwang,

2018）即以「形」為先驗形式結構，故可放置任何符合圓、方、四方位體、八面體之象

徵意義的構念或具體項目。「先驗範疇」源自康德知識論十二範疇表（Table of Categories），

先驗普世性將之擴至統籌或規範事物的「事物先驗範疇」。其儲存於種系演化史心理基

模，屬物種集體潛意識，大多無須經驗即可獲得，因其超脫文化，故為普世性。例如，

動物會歸類事物為「食物 vs.非食物」「危險 vs.安全」「我群 vs.他群」「同性 vs.異性」

3  黃光國稱作「先驗性的形式架構」或「先驗性形式架構」。其中「架構」一詞無法展示其概念蘊含的「結
構主義」，且「先驗性」等同「先驗」，故本文稱為「先驗形式結構」。黃光國稱「架構」而不稱「結構」，
似因他將「先驗性的形式架構」視為一種研究框架（research  framework），但他卻以英文 structure 稱之，
而不稱 framework，故陷入模擬兩可狀況。依李仁豪（2023）的闡析，「先驗形式結構」可以是蘊含結構
主義的「結構」，同時也是隸屬研究框架的「架構」，故黃光國所稱「先驗性的形式架構」或「先驗性形式
架構」亦能通。

5

「性訊號 vs.非性訊號」等（Lakoff, 1987）。另有非屬先驗範疇的「含攝文化範疇」（culture-

inclusive  categories），此儲存於個體發展史（ontogenesis）的心理基模，屬文化集體潛

意識，指個體從出生後即沉浸於某文化內而獲得的事物範疇，往往被視為理所當然；如

儒家「五倫」「五常」等。但由於文化受制於經驗和時空脈絡，故不必然為普世性。「事

物先驗範疇」內容有時會與「含攝文化範疇」重疊，不易區分。

  必須強調，先驗形式結構雖屬形式，不具內容，卻根源自種系演化史，來自物種長

期演化擇汰的「經驗」。同樣原理轉至方法論，雙重普世進路第一步驟設定的先驗形式

結構（指「先驗範疇」），亦能來自「經驗」。換言之，可藉由文獻回顧、內容分析、

後設分析或因素分析得來結果，暫時充當（tentative）「先驗範疇」。第二步驟便可套進

符合其要素的含攝文化現象或內容；抑或再套進其它文化內容，考其異同，進一步尋求

實徵普世性。至於以「數」和「形」做為先驗形式結構，此為更純粹形式，並非基於歸

納法、內容分析、後設分析或因素分析，但如同先驗範疇，「數」和「形」亦能套進符

合其要素的現象。依照上述步驟，便能建構一套普世暨含攝文化理論。

  一個通則是：雙重普世進路第一步驟設定的先驗形式結構，不具檢證性，可受檢驗

者是第二步驟依先驗形式結構套入的具體內容。譬如以「數」為先驗形式結構，要驗證

的非「數」本身，而是具體事項。假使發現檢驗結果不符合該數學系統推演結果，則有

兩種可能。一者觀察條件或實驗歷程或援引理論有錯；二者使用錯誤數學系統，應該嘗

試其它數學系統。數學系統何其多，有些能對應現象界，有些則不確定。必須提醒，無

論數、形或範疇，皆屬暫時充當，並非絕對。依據批判實在論的深度本體論（depth

ontology），層疊化實相（stratified reality）每一層級可能產生浮現特質（Bhaskar, 1975,

1978），而背後的數、形、範疇先驗形式結構可能隨之改變。最後，第一步驟不僅有本

體論意涵，亦可視為一種方法論策略。勞登（Larry Laudan, 1981）認為科學哲學分兩大

部門：科學的概念基礎（如物理學哲學、生物學哲學）以及科學方法論理論，後者又分

證實法（validation）和啟發法（heuristics）。絕大多數研究屬證實法，側重支配理論的

檢驗原則。啟發法則偏重如何擴大理論適用範圍，抑或何種經驗方法有助於發現新理論，

深具實效主義精神。第一步驟可視為一種啟發法，屬於引導研究、啟發靈感的通則研究

框架（general research framework），不屬於證實法，第二步驟才是。

  〈陰陽孝道論〉採雙重普世進路4，遵循「先驗普世性優先原則」，先建立先驗形式

結構（事物先驗範疇）及先天知識，使其具備先驗普世性；後續研究便可透過各種實徵

研究方法，達成實徵普世性。

三、先驗形式結構之陰陽

4  雙重普世進路之詳細闡析，見李仁豪（2023）。

6

  人類學家李維史托（Lévi-Strauss, 1959/1976）勘查各文化思維模式，發現普遍有二

元分類現象，此二元性（duality）即為先驗形式結構。儘管東、西方文化皆蘊含二元性，

然而西方文化較強調二元對立（binary opposite），華人文化所持「陰陽本體論」則以二

元互存（coexistence）為根本。以物理學比喻說明，二元對立類似電荷（electric charge），

正 電 荷 或 負 電 荷 可 單 獨 存 在 ， 不 必 依 附 對 方 才 能 存 在 ； 二 元 互 存 則 類 似 兩 磁 極

（dipolarity），南極和北極永遠成對成雙出現，不可能獨立自存（Gamow, 2005）。這是

兩者最關鍵差異所在。

        陰陽論滲透中華文化各層面，為大道之源，可謂華人文化深層結構，表現在自然學

科（天文、曆法、氣象）、實用技術（農業、醫學、建築、風水堪輿）、藝術美學（書

法、繪畫、武術、太極拳）各層面。陰陽有名無實，《繫辭上》云「一陰一陽之謂道」，

又云「形而上者謂之道，形而下者謂之器」，可知陰陽是不折不扣的形上學概念，深具

「空」之妙用，可統攝、容納萬物，被視為萬物本源。《素問．陰陽應象大論》云「陰

陽者，天地之道也，萬物之綱紀，變化之父母，生殺之本始」，又《素問．陰陽離合論》

曰「陰陽者，數之可十，推之可百，數之可千，推之可萬；萬之大，不可勝數，然其要

一也。」即表示萬物源自並統攝於陰陽。陰陽之所以為先驗形式結構，具先驗普世性，

在於其具備數、形和範疇三種展現形式，以及整體性、變形轉化、自身調控、動態均衡、

對稱性等五種結構特性。在「數」，即二進位（0、1）算則，或河圖洛書的黑白子演算。

在「形」或「象」，如太極圖或《易經》各種卦爻取象比類。在「範疇」，則指以陰陽

來統攝事物。此外，從陰陽論亦推衍出不少「含攝文化知識」，唯此不必然為普世性，

如男尊女卑等。

  陰陽特性或動力法則大抵有四，互根、互斥、互為消長、互為轉化。其機制為動態

均衡（dynamic equilibrium），也即陰陽均衡。互根是陰陽最根本特質，互為消長和互為

轉化是陰陽動態發展，互斥則兼具靜態性質和動態發展。以下說明：

1.  互根：指彼此乃一體兩面，缺一不可，共生互存，即「陰中有陽，陽中有陰」「孤陽

不生，獨陰不長」。

2.  互斥：指性質相反，如男女、寒熱、燥濕、表裏、左右、善惡、美醜、正(cid:13683)反(cid:13683)、正

能量負能量、粒子反粒子等。亦指相互排斥，此乃彼此互動產生作用力和反作用力所

致。互根加上互斥，使得陰陽雙方若離若即、彼此拉推；儘管相互排斥，卻無法離開

對方而獨立存在。

3.  互為消長：有互斥，陰陽才動得起來，才互為消長，即「此消彼長，此長彼消」。此

屬量變的動態發展。

4.  互為轉化：一方生長過旺或另一方削弱太多將導致互為轉化，所謂「重陰必陽，重陽

必陰」「物極必反」。這是陰陽最極致變化。此階段將導向另一種型態的陰陽和動態均

衡機制，抑或形成另一個循環，周而復始。這屬質變的動態發展。

參、〈陰陽孝道論〉概述

一、兩大孝道先驗範疇：群己共享、權威位階

  孝道有正、負向效果，暗示孝道至少有兩個運作成分。最合理亦最簡潔的推測當為

兩個，此亦最對稱，一者產生正向效果，另一者產生負向效果。當然這並非絕對，而是

陰中有陽，陽中有陰。藉由效果或作用推知事物本質實相，甚為合理。此即實效主義核

心概念。那麼是哪兩成分？

  楊國樞等人（1989）以楊國樞（1985）15 項孝道具體內涵撰寫 52 條題目，作為驗

證孝道的概念架構和測量工具。透過這 52 條題目進行探索性因素分析，得出「尊親懇

親」、「奉養祭念」、「抑己順親」、「護親榮親」四項成分。此外，葉光輝（1997）

研究臺灣民眾孝道觀念變遷，就這四成分下個別取 3 條代表性題目，經文字修飾並經該

調查研究預試刪題，最終得 9 題；對此 9 題從事驗證式因素分析，發現還有更高階成分

存在，一組是「尊親懇親、奉養祭念」（相關高達.85），另一組為「抑己順親、護親榮

親」（相關亦高達.85）。依其研究目的，葉氏稱前者「核心孝道觀念」，後者「變遷孝

道觀念」。

  因素分析統計法本質為求取各項目相關，逐漸往上「抽象」（abstract），由具體趨

往抽象，由內容趨往形式，抽取最精萃、涵蓋性最大（內涵最少、外延最多）成分，故

最終所得成分最不具內容，徒具形式，乃屬「範疇」。楊國樞等人（1989）和葉光輝（1997）

的孝道研究，皆基於楊國樞（1985）研究，而後者材料來自華人文化傳統典籍與人文學

者論述，因此透過內容分析、因素分析得出的成分，當屬含攝文化範疇或規範，非必然

具普世性。以下從歷史詮釋角度，找尋相應孝道範疇及其心理機制。華人文化以儒家與

孝道最相關，故從儒家切入。

  儒家認為，人際關係不出父子、君臣、夫婦、兄弟、朋友。此五倫依兩個判準歸類。

其一，血緣親屬（consanguinity）：父子、兄弟有血緣基礎為一類，君臣、朋友沒有為另

一類；於夫婦雖無血緣關係，卻是血緣起始點，為必要條件；其二，權威位階（authority

ranking）：父子、兄弟、君臣有明顯尊卑位階為一類，朋友對等為另一類，夫婦則端視

父系社會、母系社會或現代社會（講求平等、人權）而有所不同。這五倫對偶互動（dyad

interaction）法則，即源自血緣親屬（仁；慈愛心理）和權威位階（義；合宜行為），乃

為「親親法則」和「尊尊法則」，如《中庸．第二十章》云「仁者，人也，親親為大；

義者，宜也，尊賢為大。親親之殺，尊賢之等，禮所生也」，其「親親之殺」即親親法

則，「尊賢之等」為尊尊法則。

8

  五倫當以父子（親子關係）和夫婦（配偶關係）為核心，因為這兩種關係是家(cid:13687)命

脈延續或個人基因傳遞的必要條件。反觀君臣、兄弟、朋友無關生命繁衍，可有可無，

惟對社會運作和演進不無裨益。親子關係比夫妻關係更獨特、更重要，表現在三方面。

  第一，血緣關係：親子關係永遠切不斷，乃命定，不可改變，具排他性（exclusive），

獨二無一，是最早發生（出生即開始）、延續最長（終其一生）的人際關係。夫妻關係

則成年後才開始，乃萍水相逢，非命定，可改變，不具排他性。

  第二，我群歸屬：個體基因來自父母各一半，世上最親，與自己相似度最大，故我

群歸屬最強5。夫妻的我群歸屬，不如親子關係，惟透過相似性（外貌、(cid:13687)群、語言、階

級、職業、宗教信仰、政治傾向、性格、興趣、地緣等）而結合，朝夕相處，我群歸屬

當愈來愈強。

  第三，權威位階：親子關係中，父母權威地位高過子女，並且掌握資源要多於子女

（成年子女另當別論）。夫妻關係則未定。

  依據上述，「我群歸屬」（包含血緣、地緣、相似性及其它因子）和「權威位階」

為親子關係最核心成分，故可作為孝道範疇，而其對應「親親法則」和「尊尊法則」可

為運作機制。這是從特定歷史文化詮釋切入，故其含攝文化範疇與機制不必然具普世性，

唯具潛在可能。

  社會學家菲斯克（Alan Fiske, 1991）回顧人類學、社會學和心理學大量文獻，指出

「普世」人際互動關係有群己共享（communal sharing）、權威位階、平等匹配（equality

matching）、市場計價（market pricing）四種。其中「群己共享」對應〈人情與面子理論

模型〉（Hwang, 1987）中情感關係和需求法則（Sundararajan, 2015），此隸屬親人關係，

故亦可對應儒家歷史詮釋分析的我群歸屬和親親法則。緣此，「群己共享」可為孝道的

普世先驗範疇。此外，「權威位階」完全對應，故可做另一個孝道先驗範疇。至於平等

匹配和市場計價主要適用於熟人（混合關係、人情法則）和生人（工具關係、公平法則），

無涉親人關係（Sundararajan, 2015）。據此，「群己共享」和「權威位階」為兩大孝道

先驗範疇，可用來統籌「尊親懇親、奉養祭念、抑己順親、護親榮親」含攝文化規範以

及其它諸多孝道具體內涵。

  最後，「群己共享孝道」大抵對應〈雙元孝道模型〉的相互性孝道，「權威位階孝

道」則與權威性孝道相對應。然而，〈陰陽孝道論〉和〈雙元孝道模型〉的立論基礎不

盡相同。前者採雙重普世進路；後者是跨中國朝代歷史分析，總結出三階段孝道歷史發

展：先秦時期（相互性孝道相對優勢）、漢朝至清朝時期（權威性孝道主導）、民國初

年至今（傳統與現代多元呈現），並且從親子關係深層結構的孝道心理再概念化，最後

以因素分析結果加以佐證（葉光輝，2009；Yeh, 2003）。此外，該理論強調，相互性孝

道和權威性孝道絕非互斥，反而中等程度正相關（葉光輝，2009）；兩者皆包含正、負

5  在東方人腦，自我相關區域與母親相關區域部分重疊，但西方人此兩區獨立（Zhu et al., 2007）。

9

向效果，唯前者偏正面，後者偏負向（Tsao & Yeh, 2019）。換言之，相互性孝道和權威

性孝道經由兩種不同心理運作途徑達成相似家庭功能訴求：善待父母與維持家庭和諧

（曹惟純、葉光輝，2017；葉光輝，2017）。這些論點與〈陰陽孝道論〉基本相符，因

為陰陽本來就非二元對立（獨立自存），而是二元共存，並且陰陽運作機制為動態均衡，

最終方向為和諧。最後，〈雙元孝道模型〉亦遵循「一種心智、多重心態」原則，兼具

普世性及含攝文化，抑或同時蘊含個體普遍心理層次（脈絡化性格變項，contextualized

personality construct）和集體文化層次（Bedford & Yeh, 2019; Tsao & Yeh, 2019）。這點

亦與本理論殊途同歸。

二、「陽孝」與「陰孝」之界定

  儘管「群己共享孝道」和「權威位階孝道」彼此有陰陽關係，符合互根、互斥、互

為消長、互為轉化特性（稍後闡明），但其陰陽關係會在喪親後轉化，遂使該指定何者

為陰或陽不明確，易混淆。因此，本理論不對「群己共享孝道」和「權威位階孝道」賦

予陰陽稱謂，僅賦予陰陽實質，乃有實無名。本理論所謂「陽孝」指父母在世時子女盡

的孝道，而喪親後子女盡的孝道為「陰孝」。這裡視「生死」為陰陽，生為陽，死則陰
6；生死特性符合陰陽互根、互斥、消長、轉化原理。

        首先，有生就有死，有死就有生。沒有事物永恆不滅，人當然不例外。另根據熱力

學第一定律「能量不滅」，事物滅亡後會轉化為其它形式能量，繼續存於宇宙，開啟另

一種「生」或「存有」，姑且不論那能量（存有）形式為何；故有死就有生。這是互根。

  再者，凡人皆貪生怕死，生和死本質相互排斥。此端，人有求生本能動機；彼端，

死亡也命定式拉扯。海德格（Martin Heidegger）表示人對於未來唯一能確定的只有死亡

這件事，因此當「親在」（Dasein; being-there or being-in-the-world）視死亡為存在之顯

示，且視虛無為存在之總體依託時，便產生焦慮（陳榮華，2006）。人的生存根本焦慮，

就建立在生和死的矛盾對立、彼此拉扯中。這是互斥。

  最後，萬物皆有成、住、壞、空歷程，人亦有生、老、病、死過程；任何存有或生

命，皆趨往空寂或死亡。從出生到死亡，歷程如同陰陽消長及轉化。依據天人比類（天

人同構），人一生好比一年四季。冬至後，陽氣始生，陰氣漸消；夏至後，陽氣盛極而

衰，陰氣漸長；再回到冬至，此時陽氣已盡，一年結束，再周而復始。一年就在陰陽二

氣消長中度過，最後以轉化結束，啟動另一個開始。人一生亦復如是。依據上述，理論

上可用陰陽套生死。

  〈陰陽孝道論〉認為喪親事件引發一個發展斷裂，使孝道質變。大部分子女於成年

期遭遇喪親，較少於未成年期；然多數研究是以後者喪親經驗為主，這可能是考量到喪

6  華人文化習以「陽間」和「陰間」稱其場域。

10

親對未成年子女會產生較大或較負面影響。未成年子女因主要資源供給者消逝而失去情

感、經濟、物質、教育等支持，同時對父母的死沒有心理準備、父母的死屬非自然死亡、

應對策略較少或不成熟、社會支持較少等，而對身心健康、適應發展有較大、較負面影

響（Li et al., 2003; Maier & Lachman, 2000）。相較而言，成年子女各種資源支持較多、

對父母死較有心理準備、父母死多屬自然死亡、應對策略較多或成熟，因而影響較小、

負面亦少（Dahlberg, 2020; Umberson & Chen, 1994）。

  鑒於成人喪親機會較孩童多（較屬常態），並考量本研究著重孝道的道德、宗教和

文化層面，而成人道德和宗教心理行為較孩童成熟，受文化薰陶較深，故以成年子女喪

親經驗為主；然亦會參考未成年子女喪親經驗，因其喪親經驗不僅影響適應、發展，表

現諸多精神問題（Dowdney, 2000），亦延續到成年期乃至終生，影響層面甚深甚廣（Berg

et al., 2016; Finkelstein, 1988）。瞭解其中影響或調節因子，當能裨益本理論之建構。

肆、陽孝

  陽孝的情感基礎是「敬」。這裡採取類似維根斯坦（Ludwig Wittgenstein）「家(cid:13687)相

似性」（family resemblance）概念，即喜、怒、哀、樂、愛、惡、欲、憂、驚、恐各種

情緒，彼此並非互斥，而是相溶滲透，好比悲喜交加、驚喜之情等。據此，情感效應無

法從單一情緒判斷，得視與何者結合而定。就「敬」而言，其內涵可有敬愛、敬佩、敬

仰、敬畏等成分。結合「愛」則拉近距離，敬且近之即「敬愛」，指喜愛、敬佩和親近，

效果偏正向。若結合「畏」，則拉開距離，敬而遠之即「敬畏」，指畏懼、敬仰和疏遠，

效果偏負向。陽孝即奠基在(cid:13706)敬愛又敬畏、若離若即、推拉排斥的矛盾情感（表 1）。

一、群己共享陽孝

11

  群己共享孝道具體內涵為「尊親懇親」和「奉養祭念」，前者為終生孝（兼陽孝和

陰孝），後者蘊含奉養（陽孝）和祭念（陰孝），因祭念不適用群己共享陽孝，故去之。

群己共享陽孝的具體內涵即為「尊親懇親」和「奉養父母」。其情感基礎在敬愛。為何

會喜愛、敬佩、親近父母？動力來源和運作機制大致有兩個。

（一）我群偏愛（ingroup favoritism）

  此源於人皆愛自己的本性以及親子乃骨肉之事實。人大都自我中心（egocentrism）、

利己主義（egoism）、自我感覺良好（self-positivity  bias）、自我優越（the  better-than-

average effect）、自我膨脹（self-enhancement）  （Alicke & Govorun, 2005; Korn et al.,

2012; Sedikides & Gregg, 2008）。由自己進而到隸屬自己的所有人事物（如姓氏、名字、

住所、團體、(cid:13687)群等），愈像自己者，心理距離愈近，愈會被吸引，愈愛（Balliet et al.,

2014; Leyens et al., 2000）；愈不像自己者，心理距離則愈遠，愈排斥，愈不愛乃至恨，

甚至去人性化（dehumanization）（Haslam, 2015）。這是人我之別抑或我群與他群（outgroup）

之分的心理機制。子女除了基因來自父母、血緣最親，出生即與父母居住生活一起，地

緣亦最近，先天加上後天，其影響最深。故此，父母是我群歸屬中最強者，依附最深，

最親密，亦最愛。我群偏愛的孝道運作機制即為「親親」法則，內涵或規範為「尊親懇

親」。

（二）互惠利他（reciprocal altruism）

  演化生物學分析，動物之所以有利他行為，此因對方曾給予自己好處，同時也期待

自己的付出獲得回報（Trivers, 1971）。確實動物普遍會喜愛、親近那些曾照顧或幫助過

自己者，進而會有知恩圖報之心（Brosnan & de Wall, 2002）。這稱「互惠利他」，生人、

熟人皆適用（Trivers, 2010）。親人間利他則稱「親屬選擇」（kin selection），較不計代

價，只為傳遞自己或(cid:13687)群基因（Hamilton, 1964）。父母慈愛子女（慈道）大抵屬於親屬

選擇。孝道當是基於慈道（親屬選擇）的互惠利他；親子關係對偶互動，孝道與慈道無

法斷然二分。無庸置疑，父母對子女的恩惠、付出乃至犧牲，無人能比，也因此子女最

感恩、最敬佩父母，理所當然願意報恩。互惠利他的孝道運作機制即為「報」法則，內

涵或規範為「奉養父母」。此外，互惠利他促進互助合作，而互助合作亦有演化適應優

勢（Tomasello & Vaish, 2013），可達成「和諧共存」。

二、權威位階陽孝

12

  權威位階孝道內涵為「抑己順親」和「護親榮親」，皆為終生孝，故可通用權威位

階陽孝。其情感基礎在敬畏。為何會畏懼、敬仰、疏遠父母？動力來源和運作機制也有

兩個。

（一）地位尊卑

  「孝」字從老從子，其形老上子下，顯示上下位階的尊卑秩序。居上位者有指使下

位者權力，故處於下位子女會對處於上位父母產生卑微、敬仰乃至畏懼之情，並有距離

感。相對而言，處於上位父母則對處於下位的子女產生尊高、權威之情，亦產生距離感。

權力慾、掌控慾或自主慾是人的基本需求。父母掌控權力，若子女還小，自主意志和能

力尚未完全彰顯，當能順從父母。然而子女隨著成長，自主意志和掌控慾愈發強盛，親

子衝突便在所難免，除非抑制自主慾求或個性。地位尊卑的孝道運作機制為「尊尊」法

則，內涵或規範為「抑己順親」，藉此迴避衝突，形成「隱抑式虛性和諧」。這與群己

共享陽孝的「親和式實性和諧」7不同。

（二）資源施受

  父母是生活資源掌控者和施予者，子女為請託者和接受者。通常資源掌控者有發言

權、主導權和指使權力。不同於地位尊卑的權力來自地位，此權力來源為資源，但兩者

結果相似，即資源請託者子女會對資源掌控者產生卑微、敬畏之情，資源掌控者父母則

對資源請託者子女產生尊高、權威之心。再者，資源是生存必要條件，可滿足各種基本

生存需求。子女經濟未獨立前，總依靠父母，故從出生到經濟獨立這段期間累積的資源

負債，難以計量。於是，長期作為資源請託者和接受者，子女內心的無能感、自卑感和

虧欠感，日積月累，愈發強烈，因此回報父母的動機亦愈發旺盛。資源施受的孝道運作

機制為「尊尊」法則和「報」法則，內涵或規範為「抑己順親」和「護親榮親」。

  「報」（bao）或「互向規範」（the norm of reciprocity）普遍存在於人類社會（Homans,

1958），亦是人類基本道德規範之一（Gouldner, 1960）。其蘊含「公平正義」原則，或

更廣概念為「動態均衡」法則。「報」最常見報恩（正向回報）和復仇（負向回報）；

即當他人善待我，我報其恩惠；當他人對我惡行惡言相向，我報其仇恨（文崇一，1982），

藉此能滿足公平正義，達成心理均衡。「報」在各種脈絡下有不同內涵和表現，譬如隨

著人際關係範疇不同（如情感關係、工具關係或混合關係），「報」方式和期限有所不

同（黃光國，2009）。「報」亦會有文化差異，研究發現華人「報」信念，可能會透過

原諒或忍的中介變項作用於負向回報（Zhang  &  Zhang,  2012），這與西方人略有不同

（Perugini et al., 2003）。

7  有關隱抑式虛性和諧、親和式實性和諧之內涵分析，見黃囇莉（1999）。

13

  群己共享陽孝和權威位階陽孝皆有「報」法則，但前者基於互惠利他，情感基礎是

敬愛（我群偏愛），回報形式包括精神、情感、物質、勞力等各層面，涵蓋整個生命；

後者則基於資源施受，情感基礎是敬畏（地位尊卑），回報形式大抵侷限在物質和勞力

層面，這是儒家較不讚許，如《論語．為政》云：「子游問孝。子曰：『今之孝者，是
謂能養。至於犬馬，皆能有養；不敬8，何以別乎？』」

三、正、負向效果互為消長

  由於「群己共享陽孝」根源於愛己本性，可滿足愛的基本需求，以及互惠利他（互

助合作）具有達成和諧共存的演化優勢，因之產生正向效果。反觀「權威位階陽孝」乃

根源於人的權力慾、掌控慾和自主慾，以及人必得使用生活資源滿足基本生存需求之事

實，而由於親子雙方權力位階和資源施受不對等，導致子女產生自卑感、無能感與虧欠

感，因之會有負向效果。

  群己共享陽孝和權威位階陽孝互為消長。孩童時期，群己共享陽孝的正向效果常大

於權威位階陽孝的負向效果，但子女隨著成長，逐漸不依附父母，內團體數目亦逐漸增

多，稀釋掉父母我群或家庭內團體之歸屬感，於是對父母的我群偏愛與互惠利他產生的

正向效果隨之減弱；同時子女自主意志和掌控慾愈發強盛，跟父母衝突愈來愈多，由虛

性和諧轉化為虛性或實性衝突9；再加上虧欠父母的資源負債日益增加，內心無能感、自

卑感及虧欠感愈發強烈；因此，權威位階陽孝負向效果逐漸超過群己共享陽孝的正向效

果。這種狀況持續至喪親，兩者倏地陰陽轉化，群己共享陰孝由正轉負，權威位階陰孝

則由負轉正。

伍、陰孝

一、「陰孝」憑據

（一）身為宗教人

  靈性（spirituality）使人異於禽獸。宗教學者希克（John Hick, 1999）認為在科學革

命、啟蒙時代之前，人類普遍有宗教信仰。考古證據顯示從舊石器時代以來，人類普遍

有宗教行為（Armstrong, 2009）。人類學家瑪瑞特（Robert Marett, 1932）因而主張應當

以宗教人（Homo religiosus）稱人類，要比智人（Homo sapiens）更適合。據此，相信現

象界外存有超越界，似乎是人的信仰本能（Bering, 2011）。在遭遇不幸、苦難、疾病、

8  此處「不敬」當指不敬愛，非不敬畏。
9  有關虛實和諧和衝突之間的轉化歷程，詳見黃囇莉（1999）。

14

心理創傷，特別是面臨生死時，宗教信仰往往是當事人渡過這些人生關卡的重要依憑（蔡

佩真，2007）。馬林諾斯基（Malinowski, 1954）正認為宗教起源於人們對死亡的態度和

處理，可解決人往何處來、又往何處去、死後世界為何、生命意義為何等疑問。子女面

臨喪親，與父母生離死別，故而陰孝子女會產生宗教心理與行為或求助於宗教，乃人之

常情（Walsh et al., 2002）。

（二）現代人宗教信仰和來生信念

  依維基百科的資料顯示，全世界八成多人持宗教信仰（「世界主要宗教」，2023），

近一成五人無宗教信仰（包含無神論者和不可知論者）（「無神論人口」，2023）。《世

界基督教百科全書》資料顯示，從 1900 年至 2000 年，平均有宗教信仰者比例大約占八

成至八成五之間，無宗教信仰者約占一成五到兩成之間（瞿海源，2002）。臺灣中央研

究院自 1985 年進行五年一期的「臺灣社會變遷基本調查計畫」，第一次調查結果顯示

近九成人口有宗教信仰，約一成無宗教信仰。近三次調查報告（分別在 2005、2010、2015

年）則顯示約八成有宗教信仰，兩成無宗教信仰（傅仰止等人，2016）。綜上，整體而

言，有宗教信仰者約八成，無宗教信仰者約二成。

  宗教信仰者大都相信有來生，故來生信念為宗教信仰最重要憑據之一（Obayashi,

1992）。所謂「來生信念」或「死後信念」（belief in afterlife）指「個體對於人死後所

將面臨處境的真實性之確信」（蔡明昌，2007）。蔡明昌、歐慧敏（2008）發現大部分

臺灣大學生對是否相信來生，都半信半疑，因此對於來生，「確信其有」與「確信其無」

兩個概念同時存在。故此，稍後 Likert 七點尺度量表（量表中間值為 4）不以單題施測

（如：從非常相信來生到非常不相信），而分成「確信有來生」和「確信無來生」兩題，

結果顯示前者（M=4.47）顯著大於後者（M=3.72）。

  他們同時探索大學生「來生境況」和「決定機制」信念。「來生境況」指死後世界、

場域或去處，如天堂（極樂世界）、地獄、另一個人間（黃泉、幽都、泰山）、變鬼成

神、輪迴投胎等。「決定機制」指決定來生境況如何運作的機制，如因果報應、審判（經

由人格神賞善罰惡，如上帝、閻羅王等）、救贖（因信稱義、信得永生）、自然法則等。

結果顯示，來生境況中，輪迴投胎（M=4.72）顯著高於其它。另於決定機制，因果報應

（M=4.50）顯著高於其它。由此可知，大學生最相信因果報應和輪迴投胎（另見蔡明昌，

2018）。值得一提，無論有無宗教信仰者，皆傾向相信有來生，也相信因果報應和輪迴

投胎。有研究用網路普查方式，發現約六成人傾向信「佛教前世、今生、來世因果循環

教義」（尤煌傑，2003）。瞿海源（2002，66-67 頁）調查表明，七成受訪者相信死後有

靈魂，僅一成七不相信；無宗教信仰者也有六成多相信靈魂存在。

  綜上所述，無論有無宗教信仰，多數現代人相信有來生、靈魂、因果報應和輪迴投

胎。本理論陰孝即以此為依憑，特指因果報應（業）。

15

（三）孝道宗教性

  「孝」最初蘊含濃厚宗教意味。西周《大克鼎》銘云：「天子明哲，覯孝於申」，

其「覯」意「顯」，「申」解作「神」；《仲師父鼎》銘云：「其用享用孝于皇祖帝考」；

《虞司寇壺》銘云：「其用享用孝，用祈眉壽，子子孫孫，永寶用之」；《陳逆簠》銘

云：「以享以孝于大宗皇祖皇妣」。這些銅器銘文記載的「用享用孝」或「以享以孝」，

指祭祀祖先神靈（韓高年，2017）。由此可知，孔子之前孝的主要互動對象是超越界，

如祖先或神，誠如《國語．周語下》云「言孝必及神」。至於倫理規範意義的孝，得等

到孔子之後才完全彰顯，但也不完全摒棄「陰孝」。

  事實上，孔子極重視陰孝。宰我向孔子抱怨三年喪太久，被責「不仁」10。由此亦

可知，孔子最重視「仁」，首要落實到具體孝行；倘能實踐孝道，無論陽孝或陰孝，便

展現仁。孔子表示「父在，觀其志；父沒，觀其行；三年無改於父之道，可謂孝矣。」

（《論語‧學而》），此亦屬陰孝。又孔子界定孝的基本道德規範「無違」，乃指「生事

之以禮，死葬之以禮，祭之以禮」，其中「死葬之以禮，祭之以禮」即屬陰孝。此外，

曾參是孔子弟子中著名孝子，《論語》記載曾子提及孝三次，兩次關於陰孝，分別是「慎

終追遠，民德歸厚矣」（《論語．學而》）及「吾聞諸夫子：人未有自致者也，必也親

喪乎！」（《論語．子張》）可見曾子甚重視陰孝。

  有關孝蘊含宗教性的文獻和觀點，頗零散瑣碎，明代虞淳熙是較系統闡述陰孝者之

一。他認為孝不僅是倫理道德規範，更有超越向度，在宇宙創生前即已存在，是宇宙萬

物、自然人文秩序源頭，同時也是維繫世界和諧的應然規範（呂妙芬，2011，見第四章）。

虞氏重要著作《孝經集靈》，主要根據《孝經．感應章》「孝悌之至，通於神明，光于

四海，無所不通」，蒐集歷代各類文本中有關《孝經》的故事和言說，涉及許多神通靈

異、孝感神應事蹟；其有不少陰孝例子值得參考。虞氏認為人人心中有神明，即天賦良

知，而「感通神明」即人心中神明與主宰宇宙之神明相互感應，此須有工夫論引導。他

遂於〈全孝心法〉提出實踐齋戒心法：「可見此身不但是父母遺體，也是天地遺體，又

是太虛遺體。保養遺體之法不過馭氣攝靈一事；馭氣攝靈不過愛、敬兩字。愛之極為敬，

敬之至為齋，齋戒洗心到得浩然之氣塞乎兩間，赫然之光照乎四表，方纔是全孝，方纔

叫孝子。」準此，「愛、敬」為孝道工夫論根本。

二、陽孝轉陰孝

10  《論語．陽貨》載：「宰我問：『三年之喪，期已久矣。君子三年不為禮，禮必壞；三年不為樂，樂必
崩。舊穀既沒，新穀既升，鑽燧改火，期可已矣。』子曰：『食夫稻，衣夫錦，於女安乎？』曰：『安。』
『女安則為之！夫君子之居喪，食旨不甘，聞樂不樂，居處不安，故不為也。今女安，則為之！』宰我出。
子曰：『予之不仁也！子生三年，然後免於父母之懷。夫三年之喪，天下之通喪也。予也，有三年之愛於
其父母乎？』」

16

  孝道因喪親而陰陽轉化，儘管陽孝和陰孝的普世先驗範疇不變，具體內涵僅些微改

變（陽孝無祭念父母，陰孝無奉養父母），但兩者情感基礎、動力來源、運作機制和效

果表現已劇烈變化。

  陰孝的情感基礎為「悔」。「悔」英語為 regret，源自古法語 regres，原意為傷心或

失望。到了十五世紀，此詞彙首度進入英語，乃描述喪失親友或地位的悲痛。在當時，

regret 是一種表演，「做出後悔的樣子」（regrettes）以加重表達哀傷，例如守靈時的哀

悼和葬禮上的哭泣。十六世紀，regret 漸與一種自我內化的概念結合，才開始形成帶著

自我責備意味的現代語義。然而，至今 regret 仍然維持早先與「失落」（喪失親友）的

連結（Smith, 2015/2016, pp. 367-368）。

陰孝「悔」如陽孝「敬」亦採取類似家(cid:13687)相似性概念，情感效應無法從單一情緒判

斷，視與何者結合而定。「悔」蘊含悲悔、悔恨、悔悟、悔改等成分。「悔」原指人因

某些事該做卻未做或不該做卻做了而產生的情緒。若自怨自艾、自責抱憾、活在過去、

不知改變，使「悔」與悲傷結合，成「悲悔」，或與歉疚結合，成「悔恨」，則偏負向

效果。若心境轉化，對於該做卻未做，可於未來彌補，而不該做卻做了，儘管覆水難收，

若於未來碰到類似情事時引以為鑑，避免重蹈覆轍，也能做其它事彌補，則會產生正向

效果。人非聖賢，孰能無過，關鍵在幡然悔悟，《易經．復卦》「不遠復，(cid:13704)祗悔，元

吉」，因此「悔」並非僅是負面，亦有正面。朱熹表達最精確：「悔自凶而趨吉」。故

「悔」結合覺悟成「悔悟」，結合改過則成「悔過」，便偏正向效果。

  大抵而言，悲悔、悔恨會使人失去生命動力，悔悟、悔過則激起生命動力。陰孝就

建立在(cid:13706)悲悔又悔悟、(cid:13706)悔恨又悔過、趨死趨生的矛盾情感（表 2）。

三、群己共享陰孝

17

  群己共享孝道內涵為「尊親懇親」和「奉養祭念」。前者為終生孝，可通用陰孝，

後者蘊含奉養（陽孝）和祭念（陰孝），因奉養不適用群己共享陰孝，故去之。群己共

享陰孝內涵即為「尊親懇親」和「祭念父母」。其情感基礎為悲悔和悔恨。悲悔的動力

來源為失落，運作法則為親親法則；悔恨的動力來源為歉疚，運作法則為業法則。

（一）失落（loss）

  父母是骨肉，世上最親的人。父母離開人世，骨肉分離、天人永隔，失落感之強烈，

不言而喻。此失落感帶來哀傷悲痛，乃人之常情；惟華人孝道更強化，理由有三。首先，

華人父母乃自我一部分（Zhu et al., 2007），父母過世彷彿自己一部分亦離開人世，失落

感更深更重。其次，較遵循傳統家庭價值和角色規範的社會文化，陰孝子女死亡率較高，

此當與失落感有關（Saarela & Rostilla, 2018）；華人文化屬家(cid:13687)取向（楊國樞、葉明華，

2005），故會強化失落感。最後，華人文化在守喪或守孝習俗期間，須遵守某些規範。

其中子女表現悲慟、哀戚之情最為重要，甚至有所謂「五子哭墓」或「孝女白琴」喪禮

儀式，哭得愈傷心、愈悲慘，愈展現孝心，如此當會強化子女的悲痛。上述三點或許亦

能成為群己共享陰孝具體內涵，合稱「悲以表孝」。

  失落的孝道運作機制為「親親」法則，有愛才會有悲，才會失落；且愈親愈愛，失

落感愈大，愈是悲傷。

  喪親往往不利子女的身心健康、適應發展，其調節或中介變項不少，諸如父母死於

預期自然死亡（如慢性病、老化衰竭）或非自然死亡（如意外事件、自殺）、性別差異

（父 vs.子、父 vs.女、母 vs.子、母 vs.女）、年齡（過世父母、當時子女年齡）、家庭教

養、社經地位、教育程度、家(cid:13687)疾病史、親子關係、父母性格、子女喪親後照顧者適應

狀況等（Berg et al., 2016; Dowdney, 2000）。更重要的是，端視子女的喪親應對策略，

這是自己所能掌控；大致有逃避、反芻、正面應對、尋求支持、壓力評估、控制信念、

維持自尊等（Lazarus & Folkman, 1991; Schmiege et al., 2006）。

本理論從道德和宗教層面切入，認為有個策略或機轉能夠轉化，使子女不僅能渡過

喪親此人生難關，更能提升生命境界，使人卓越化，亦使人與人、人與自然關係和諧化。

其機制為權威位階陰孝「補償」，而「補償」與群己共享陰孝另一動力來源「歉疚」密

切相關。

（二）歉疚（remorse, shame or guilty）

  僅管親人（父母、手足、親戚）、伴侶、摯友等重要他人過世，常人皆會失落、哀

傷，但父母過世還會伴隨虧欠感、歉疚感、悔恨感乃至罪惡感。父母對子女的恩惠，無

人能比，因此子女感激父母且深感虧欠而欲以回報，乃人之常情。父母在世已難以報盡

恩惠，況且父母過世後無以回報，心中遺憾悔恨或罪惡感必油然而生。儒家文化向來強

18

調反求諸己，可能會將父母部分死因歸於未善盡身為子女之本份，同時儒家和佛教皆極

強調報恩，特別是父母之恩（王志楣，1994），這可能更強化子女罪惡感和歉疚感。這

亦能成為群己共享陰孝具體內涵，稱「責己顯孝」。

  歉疚的孝道運作機制為「業」法則。「業」有五大特徵。（1）道德性；（2）因果

性；（3）公平正義原則；這三項特徵大致雷同「報」，惟因果性有差異。「業」屬自作

自受，自己造業自己擔，造因者和承受結果者皆是道德主體自身；抑或承受者以家人或

家(cid:13687)為單位11，這屬華人傳統文化固有思想，為家(cid:13687)取向；抑或藉由「迴向」轉至他人。

「報」則不然，造因者和承受結果者皆為他人，自己屬中介或反動角色，具回報（repay）、

報恩（requite）或報復（retaliate）反向能力。

  至於另兩個「業」特徵（4）訴諸超越界、（5）來生之預設，是與「報」最關鍵之

差異所在，這兩點「報」都沒有。報法則適用的範圍為人世間，互動對象是實際活人。

孝道互動對象是父母，一旦父母過世，報法則隨之失效。然而，「報」的三個原理道德

性、因果性、公平正義，並不就此消失，所以必須援引同樣蘊含此三原理但尚訴諸超越

界、來生之預設的「業」，做為陰孝運作法則。事實上，研究顯示「業」信念與上述這

五大特徵確實相關，各種文化和宗教背景樣本（印度、美國、加拿大）結果皆類似（White

et al., 2019）。「業」的運作機制為「業力」，屬超越界力量，能促使因果報應，解決「德

福一致」的道德哲學難題。預設人格神閻羅王、鬼神或上帝作道德審判，則屬民間信仰、

道家、基督宗教或其它宗教，相信者亦不少，僅次於業報（蔡明昌、歐慧敏，2008）。

這裡業法則若採廣義界定，亦含括此種決定機制。

  無論非人格化因果報應，還是人格神賞善罰惡果報，皆是維繫過去中國社會秩序的

重要機制，也是落實孝道的重要因素。藉由社會流傳各種善書、緯書，並透過家(cid:13687)、民

間宗教團體和官方朝廷推動，不斷傳達「孝能感通神明而召致瑞應」、「至孝感天而召

致福報」、「不孝遭惡報」、「孽子下地獄」，這些信念遂深植人心（呂妙芬，2011）。

因此，絕不能小觑業法則在孝道的作用。

四、權威位階陰孝

  權威位階孝道先驗規範為「抑己順親」和「護親榮親」，為終生孝，故可通用權威

位階陰孝。其情感基礎在悔悟和悔過，動力來源為解放和補償，運作機制為「道道」法

則和業法則。

（一）解放（liberation）

11  如《易經．坤卦．文言》云：「積善之家，必有餘慶；積不善之家，必有餘殃。」

19

  親子互動衝突源於權力位階和資源施捨不對等，表現在價值觀不合（人生目標、志

業選擇不同、父母要求違反道德或悖於倫理）、角色困境（子女角色和義務與其他角色

衝突，或父母爭吵時，子女處在中間，偏袒哪一方都會引起另一方不悅，深陷兩難），

以及父母要求超出子女能力所及，其中「價值觀不合」最多，以人數算占 98%，以事件

算占 60%（葉光輝，2008），故最關鍵、最頻繁、最持久，亦最難處理。然而，在父母

過世後，這些衝突遂不復存，陽孝「抑己順親」諸多壓力頓然而解，尤其是父母原本可

能壓迫子女的價值觀、意志或行動，乃至箝制子女人生之路，此時子女便能完全展現自

主意志，自走人生路。依此，解放孝道運作機制為「道道」法則。

  「道」此字從走從首。「道道」之首「道」，作動詞，從走，意為行走、行動、實

踐；次「道」作名詞，從首，意為首要、方向、目的。合言即追尋終極價值及實踐人生

道路。人生道路分「小道」和「大道」，前者指滿足個人小我的成就動機，後者指滿足

利他大愛的慈悲動機，如《禮記．禮運》云：「大道之行也，天下為公」。凡人皆有小

我（利己）和大我（利他）兩成分（李仁豪，2019），唯小我較具主導意識，常欲維護、

展現、成就自我。欲行「大道」常須適度抑制或犧牲小我，此即陰孝「抑己順親」（亦

含括「護親榮親」）意涵。就此而言，陽孝和陰孝之所以「抑己」，動機和目的皆為遵

循群體規範、追求群體和諧，然而兩者指涉的「群體」不盡相同。在陽孝，群體侷限在

父母我群或家庭，規範亦來於此，抑制或犧牲小我以達成家庭和諧，延續家(cid:13687)命脈。在

陰孝，群體則已然跳脫我群而擴及他群，規範來自社會或全人類，追求社會、全人類乃

至宇宙萬物和諧共存及生生不息。這如何與孝道連結？其機制為「補償」，稍後闡述。

  除親子衝突壓力外，尚有其它壓力源亦隨喪親而解除。子女長大成人，經濟獨立，

擁有愈來愈多資源，反觀父母逐漸老邁、多病，面臨退休乃至死亡，雙方資源施受角色

遂互換，子女反施予資源，父母接受資源。不同於陰孝未成年子女的父母往往非自然死

亡，陰孝成人子女的父母通常自然死亡，可能患慢性病、行動不便或臥病在床，極需子

女照料，這種情況可能造成子女極大精神壓力（擔憂父母死亡、眼看父母病痛、佔許多

時間、醫療或保險支付壓力等），若不妥善照顧父母，恐會負「久病無孝子」惡名。一

旦父母過世，這些諸多壓力隨之釋放（Umberson & Chen, 1994），另還能繼承遺產，這

些對子女當屬正向效果（Rostila & Saarela, 2011）。然而，這些正向效果屬短期，隨時間

流逝逐漸減弱，甚至淹没於群己共享陰孝的失落和歉疚負面效果，如 Rostila 與 Saarela

（2011）表示：「Time does not consequently heal all wounds, as long-term grief and regret

at the loss of the parent might outweigh the short-term relief from burdens and worries.」可惜

他們未深究其機轉，亦未提出解決之道。

（二）補償（compensation）

20

  「解放」的正向效果不僅持續短，且局限於個人（小我）。若要延續正向效果並擴

及他人（大我），須藉「補償」達成。「補償」是一種應對策略或防衛機轉，與其它策

略和機轉最大不同處在於其運作法則來自業（報），蘊含道德性、因果性、公平正義及

宗教性。

  表面上，親子間衝突、壓力和負面效果隨喪親而消失，實則不然；雁過必留痕，多

少仍牽動子女身心。同時，子女感恩、虧欠父母，無以回報，歉疚感和罪惡感亦難化解。

這種道德罪惡感須靠德行或宗教力量化解。需悔悟、悔改，方能「自凶而趨吉」。可藉

補償作用來彌補曾因衝突或其它情事忤逆父母的不孝以及對父母養育之恩的虧欠。(cid:13706)然

與父母的實際互動已不可能，故其補償作用轉向至其它兩方面來表現：與自己互動，以

及與他人乃至萬物互動。

  與自己互動指更珍惜自己生命，同時傳宗接代，實踐慈道，保護並延續父母命脈，

藉道道法則獲功成名就，榮耀雙親。此隸屬「小道」（小我）的「護親榮親」。緒論提

及，有所成就者早年喪父比例大於預期值（Eisenstadt,  1978），以及智商高於 155 者早

年喪親比例三倍於預期值（Albert, 1971），本理論可合理解釋。一來，陽孝「抑己順親」

對個體性格和認知發展的負向效果，如壓抑、服從、保守、或缺乏彈性、自我表達、創

造力、認知複雜度等，喪親後隨之減弱或消失甚至反彈，子女全身心「解放」。二來，

為彌補內心對父母的歉疚或罪惡感，藉道道法則引發動力投注於工作或創作活動。

  與他人乃至萬物的互動，依親疏分為親人、熟人、生人及宇宙萬物。研究顯示喪親

會影響子女對親人互動（Fuller-Thomson, 2000），然而熟人、生人研究幾乎闕如，遑論

宇宙萬物。再者，儘管少數研究提到補償作用，但其指填補喪失父母情感支持後空缺，

如親人感、家(cid:13687)穩定性、個人肯定等（Umberson,  2003），未涉及道德和宗教層面。這

與本理論所言「補償」意涵完全不同。

  補償的互動對象可從我群（包含親人）擴及他群，乃至天地萬物。前者如《孟子．

梁惠王》所言：「老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼」，其補償行為指「為善去惡」，

即眾善奉行、諸惡莫作，藉此回報父母；佛教詞彙為「迴向」。後者則視天地如父母，

天（乾）象徵父，地（坤）象徵母，抑或父母生命源自天地，故亦能藉化育天地宇宙萬

物（簡稱「化育萬物」）來實踐孝道，即愛護地球12、維護生態13，此乃孝道最徹底、最

究竟、最圓滿、最高境界實踐14。緣此，眾善奉行、諸惡莫作、愛護地球、維護生態為

權威位階陰孝新成分，隸屬大道（大我）「抑己順親」和「護親榮親」的具體內涵，終

極目的則是宇宙萬物「和諧共存」及「生生不息」。

12  此屬積極義務；如當環保義工、認養流浪貓狗、改吃素食（基於慈悲心）、節約能源。
13  此屬消極義務；如不破壞環境、不殘害動物。
14  張載《西銘》：「乾稱父，坤稱母；予茲藐焉，乃混然中處。故天地之塞，吾其體；天地之帥，吾其性。
民，吾同胞；物，吾與也。」

21

五、正、負向效果互為消長

  「群己共享陰孝」運作機制為親親法則和業法則。親親法則從陽孝到陰孝，失落遂

生悲悔，乃至悲以表孝。業法則導致歉疚感、悔恨感，乃至責己顯孝。此處「業」指過
去因造現在果15，較會產生宿命論消極想法。依據上述，群己共享陰孝偏負向效果。

「權威位階陰孝」運作機制為道道法則和業法則。道道法則由於親子衝突不復存，

同時孝道相關其它壓力源隨喪親而消逝，子女身心隨之「解放」，遂完全展現自主意志，

朝向小道和大道。至於業法則，乃藉悔悟、悔改催使運作「補償」心理，實踐小道和大

道；特別是大道經為善去惡和化育萬物，達至孝道實踐之最高境界。此處「業」指現在

因造未來果16，這種當下行為決定未來的想法信念，有創造命運的積極作用。綜上所述，

權威位階陰孝偏正向效果。

  權威位階陰孝和群己共享陰孝的正、負向效果乃互為消長。父母剛過世，群己共享

陰孝的失落和歉疚立即起作用，悲悔和悔恨為主導情緒，悔悟和悔改尚未浮現，權威位

階陰孝的「補償」作用尚未運作，雖有「解放」正向效果，但持續較短；故整體而言，

群己共享陰孝負向效果大於權威位階陰孝的正向效果。時間是療傷良藥，子女的失落感、

悲痛會逐漸淡去，但父母恩惠負債還在，因而歉疚感、悔恨不會消失，除非子女能悔悟、

悔改，開始「補償」，實踐小道和大道回報父母，如此負債便逐漸抵銷，終達平衡。依

此，群己共享陰孝負向效果逐漸消弱，權威位階陰孝正向效果則逐漸增強並超過前者，

最終達到宇宙萬物和諧共存、生生不息之境地。

陸、綜合討論

一、普世又多元之孝道

  「孝道」研究不等同「親子關係」研究，後者不預設文化因素，孝道有，它須在歷

史、文化、漢語脈絡才彰顯其深刻意義。再者，親子關係研究不預設超越界，僅涉及人

間親子實際互動，故限於陽孝；若從文化系統切入，孝道毫無疑問蘊含陰孝。儘管孝道

屬華人文化重要價值觀，其仍有普世情感基礎和運作機制之成分。事實上，〈陰陽孝道

論〉從深層普世人性剖析揭示孝道內涵和機制。然關鍵在於如何建構符合「一種心智，

多重心態」的孝道理論，這是一大難題。

  本土心理學者較強調多重心態，突顯東、西方文化差異，譬如黃光國（2009）認為

孝道是華人文化特色，無法套用西方倫理學解釋。黃氏依據康德倫理學和 Gert（1973）

15  抑或前世因造今生果。
16  抑或今生因造來生果。

22

觀點，說明「消極義務」（negative duty）要人不為（如不可殺人、偷盜、說謊），不論

任何時空、情境脈絡皆應遵守，具強制性，故屬「完全義務」（perfect duty）；若違反

則為罪惡（vice）。相對地，「積極義務」（positive duty）要人有作為（如眾善奉行），

其為導引行動的格律（maxim），較不會表明具體行為，不界定使用範圍，並允許例外，

不具強制性，故屬「不完全義務」（imperfect  duty）；若未實踐則僅缺乏美德（lack of

virtue），不為罪惡。然而，這無法套用孝道，因為儒家文化規範子女必須「盡孝」，屬

積極義務，卻具強制性，故屬完全義務，而非不完全義務；「不孝」為不可原諒之罪惡，

非僅缺乏美德。據此，孝道當屬「無條件積極義務」（unconditioned positive duty）。然

而，西方人可能也如此。

  西方文化有濃厚的宗教成分，屬一神教，八成西方人持有宗教信仰（瞿海源，2002），

所有信徒須遵守戒律，如十誡。前四誡是人與超越界互動誡律；後六誡是人際互動規範，

其中五誡（殺、淫、盜、謊、貪）皆屬消極義務，亦屬完全義務，具強制性，另一誡為

唯一例外屬積極義務誡律即「孝敬父母」。其依十誡統整性，亦當屬完全義務，具強制

性，若違反則屬罪惡，非僅缺乏美德，如同「孝道」。依此，黃氏說法值得商榷。反而

「孝道」當有普世成分（此處專指實徵普世性）；更確切地說，「孝道」是極獨特的道

德規範，有別於其它積極義務，而雖獨特卻普世。事實上，跨文化研究顯示東、西方文

化皆有三個孝道成分，分別是尊敬與服從、取悅父母和財務支持（Ng et al., 2000）。後

兩者隸屬群己共享孝道的尊親懇親和奉養父母，而前一者的服從隸屬權威位階孝道的抑

己順親，至於尊敬（respect）則端視與「愛」或「畏」何者結合而偏向群己共享（敬愛）

或權威位階（敬畏）。

  雙重普世進路指出實徵普世性可透過跨文化研究、發展研究、貫時研究達成。跨文

化研究未考量時間因素，有所不足，須由發展研究和貫時研究彌補。譬如葉光輝（1997）

研究各孝道項目時代變遷狀況，發現有些項目如百依百順、傳宗接代、繼承家業、隨侍

在側等，眾人重視或認同程度漸趨式微，而奔喪祭念、奉養父母、使親無憂、事親以禮

仍受相當重視和認同。不隨時空脈絡變動的成分，較可能具普世性。隨時空脈絡變動的

成分，普世性可能較小，其有三種文化差異型態。首先，各文化皆有，唯重視或認同程

度不一，此屬量變。其次，各文化皆有，但具體行為表現不同，即多元化，例如奔喪祭

念方式隨各宗教信仰有所不同。這兩種即「一種心智，多重心態」，仍在普世性範疇內。

最後一種已質變，無普世成分，即某些文化有，某些文化沒有，如殉葬、殺嬰。依此判

準，「變遷孝道觀念」不見得不具普世性，端視屬量變、多元化呈現，還是質變。

二、正、負向效果之謎

23

  本理論基於實效主義立場，以作用、效果推測實在本質。研究顯示孝道有正、負向

效果，且因素分析找出兩大因子，故合理推測有兩種運作成分；據此，再以「社群互享」

和「權威位階」兩種普世人際互動原型，做為孝道兩大先驗範疇。按演化觀解釋，「群

己共享陽孝」對個體心理需求（愛）和群體層次（家庭凝聚力或和諧）有適應優勢，偏

正向效果，被天擇保存理所當然；反觀「權威位階陽孝」較不利個體適應發展，偏負向

效果，為何亦被保留下來？想必附帶正向效果，如同疾病基因亦會帶來些好處。以下闡

析幾種可能：

（1）父母為資源施予者，子女抑己順親當可獲得資源。換言之，「權威位階陽孝」有助

於父母慈道持續運作，提供資源以滿足子女的基本生存需求。這是在個體需求層次；（2）

子女能藉由父母施予資源和指使權力之過程中，學到社會規範和人際互動法則（如尊尊

法則或各種獲得資源策略等）。這是從個體層次跨越到群體層次的關鍵；（3）在群體層

次，上述兩點若成立，當能促進家庭和諧共存，儘管虛性和諧成分居多；（4）從動力發

展來看，「權威位階陽孝」在喪親後轉為陰孝，便會顯現正向效果。

  「群己共享陰孝」亦偏負向效果，為何會被保留下來？本質上，陰孝依附陽孝，陽

孝是主，陰孝是從，陰孝種種特性大致由陽孝而來。人皆經歷陽孝，體驗陰孝者相對少

些；未經陰孝自己先過世者，為數不少。再者，出生那一刻陽孝就開始運作，發展軌跡

較明確，但陰孝起始點變數較大，可能從孩童、青少年、成年、中年，甚至步入老年後

父母才過世。因之，陽孝較為必要、常態及規律。據此，演化擇汰主要在陽孝，而非陰

孝。(cid:13706)然「群己共享陽孝」因具明顯適應優勢而被保留，「群己共享陰孝」便同時被保

留，即使偏負向效果。況且「群己共享陰孝」的失落、悲慟、歉疚、悔恨並非全然負面，

它們與「權威位階陰孝」彼此為陰陽關係；後者的正向效果或適應優勢乃奠基於前者，

譬如歉疚感為回報父母的動力來源，罪惡感為子女贖罪的動力來源。

  總之，儘管「權威位階陽孝」偏負向效果，仍有不少正向效果。若從「群己共享陽

孝」角度，「權威位階陽孝」實不可或缺。試想喪親後，正負轉化，若僅有「群己共享

陰孝」負向效果，無其它機制抗衡和轉化，子女該如何渡過此人生難關？幸虧能藉由「權

威位階陰孝」將其負向效果轉回正向效果。同理，「群己共享陰孝」雖偏負向效果，但

因其依附「群己共享陽孝」，及其做為「權威位階陰孝」正向效果的動力來源，實有適

應優勢以及存在之必要。

三、中年危機與孝道

  本理論以陰陽論做為形上預設和思考框架，以喪親關鍵事件分孝道為陽孝和陰孝。

多數人成年後才經歷喪親，以中年期（40 歲至 55 歲）最多。中年期頗特殊，榮格（Carl

Jung, 1971）極重視此時期，認為有最多長成，可統整未發展完成的人格，並擁有尚待開

24

發的其它種種面向，尤其靈性。艾利克森（Erik  Erikson, 1963）則認為此期衝突危機是

「創發 vs.遲滯」（generativity vs. stagnation）。若能傳承，照顧下一世代，或能從事創

作活動，促進文化發展，危機便能解決。若不能，將陷入遲滯和自我沉溺。這與本理論

「權威位階陰孝」內涵相符不悖，即喪親經驗當會促進中年期發展，產生雙重正負效應，

彼此拉扯。

  中年人正處於陰陽交接時刻，這不僅指生命歷程，亦指孝道歷程。假使人平均年齡

80 歲，那麼 40 歲正在中間，此時處於夏至，陽氣盛極而衰，陰氣漸長，為生命陰陽消

長之關鍵點。中年期往往開始正視死亡、重視靈性、關懷眾生。至於孝道，若陽孝於中

年期因喪親而轉為陰孝，則開啟「解放」和「彌補」契機。中年期充滿矛盾、衝突、動

盪、混沌、迷惑（Jaques, 1965）。一方面，青春逝去，肉體不老、青春永駐幻覺終究覺

醒，喟然感嘆；另一方面，死亡逼近，對於必死宿命及生死無常的不確定性束手無策，

兀自焦慮（Becker, 1973）。中年人遂處於創發與遲滯、世俗與宗教、過去與未來、青春

與老化、生與死的推拉排斥之矛盾感受中。父母老病終于死，這殘酷事實衝擊子女內心，

更強化此類感受（Gould, 1978）。

  總之，中年喪親效應雙重，(cid:13706)是危機，也是契機，子女可藉此探索生命更深層意義

（Douglas, 1991; Gerson, 2018），特別在道德和宗教層面，重新思考自己跟自己、他人、
自然界、超越界的互動關係17。本理論認為最重要心理機制當是：由於父母恩惠浩天罔

極，終生難報，此乃一大缺憾，無法滿足「報」的公平正義法則，故處於嚴重失衡、非

對稱狀態，遂產生「補償」作用，欲藉創發、傳承（慈道）、行善、大愛來彌補，通往

小道（為親留後、顯揚親名）和大道（為善去惡、化育萬物），達到均衡、完整、圓滿

之理想境界。

四、〈陰陽孝道論〉的特色、貢獻與局限

  本理論方法學特色為採「雙重普世進路」，以滿足「一種心智，多重心態」原則。

在本體論，茲以陰陽做為先驗形式結構，遂能結合「群己共享」和「權威位階」兩種普

世人際互動原型，並對應〈孝道雙元模型〉相互性孝道和權威性孝道。在知識論，本理

論大抵滿足各種理論規範，這裡僅說明完備性和整合性。

  在完備性，本理論使孝道擴及終生，含括陰孝，提出悲以表孝、責己顯孝、為善去

惡、化育萬物四項新孝道內涵，並蘊含親親、尊尊、報、業四個法則，恰好對應孝道觀

17  在西方個人主義（individualism）預設下，「人」（the person）和「自我」（the self）較侷限於自身（egocentric），
然在其它文化脈絡，「人」和「自我」卻常隱含更廣層面，擴及社會（sociocentric）、生態界（ecocentric）
乃至整個宇宙（cosmocentric）（Kirmayer, 2007）。華人文化的自我觀及「天人合一」形上預設即是如此。
〈陰陽孝道論〉跳脫個人主義窠臼，採「天人合一」的自我觀，故能創造或發展出陰孝中「補償」機制和
「道道」法則。

25

念變遷的情感、權威、交換和宗教四種影響因素（葉光輝，1997）。〈孝道雙元模型〉

以及其它所有孝道研究，皆未考量喪親後的孝道，亦缺乏宗教因素運作機制，本理論提

出「陰孝」概念以及「業」法則，是一大特點及貢獻。除親親、尊尊、報、業四法則外，

本理論還提出「道道」法則。「道道」雖為自造詞，然其概念內涵實存在於華人文化儒、

釋、道思想內，且有普世人性基礎（如自利和利他）。儒家思想有「親親」和「尊尊」

兩大重要運作法則（黃光國，2009），〈孝道雙元模型〉率先援引此兩詞彙和概念於孝

道研究（葉光輝，2005；Yeh, 2003）。然而，儒家另一重要概念「推己及人」、「天下

為公」、「世界大同」、「天人合德」等，卻被孝道研究者忽略。這個概念與佛教和道

家相符，可統攝至「天人合一」思想，其為三教合一的根基（李仁豪，2020）。有鑑於

此，本文提出蘊含天人合一的「道道」法則，含「小道」和「大道」，前者自利，成就

自己，後者利他，化育萬物，通往天人合德，可與親親、尊尊、業、報並立，合為孝道

運作法則。

  在整合性，針對孝道研究和喪親研究的正、負向效果之謎，本理論以情感基礎、人

性需求、心理機制加以解釋，並援引陰陽論統攝之。儘管〈孝道雙元模型〉亦能解陽孝

研究之謎題，但其解釋與本理論不盡相同。譬如該理論以水平軸和垂直軸看待「相互性

孝道」和「權威性孝道」，認為「相互性孝道」親子關係地位對等，視彼此為獨特個體，

類似友誼模型的情感基礎和互動關係（English, 1979; Tsao & Yeh, 2019），或類似「平等

匹配」人際互動原型。如此觀點將「相互性孝道」和「權威性孝道」共擺在地位向度比

較。本理論卻非如此，而是從不同向度個別看待「群己共享孝道」和「權威位階孝道」，

認為前者是基於血緣而產生我群偏愛和互惠利他，後者則基於地位、權威、資源而產生

地位尊卑和資源施受。依此，僅「權威位階孝道」蘊含地位向度，「群己共享孝道」沒

有。

  任何理論皆不可能十全十美，毫無缺失或局限，〈陰陽孝道論〉亦不例外。首先，

前述提及，人皆經歷陽孝，體驗陰孝者相對少些，以及陽孝發展軌跡較明確，陰孝起始

點變數較大，這對實驗設計與資料解釋增添不少困難。例如：各年齡層的生命歷練和心

境必有差異，因此青少年、成年、中年乃至老年時喪親的行為表現和心理機制，可能各

自不同，然〈陰陽孝道論〉未別其異同。再者，喪親有失恃，有失怙，亦有雙親俱歿，

此三者的陰孝內涵（情感基礎、動力來源、運作機制、效果表現）可能有微妙差異，然

〈陰陽孝道論〉未區分這三者。最後，〈陰陽孝道論〉以喪親做為關鍵事件，將孝道發

展分為陰孝和陽孝兩階段，但實際上可能不只這兩階段。譬如亦能以青春期（反抗期）、

成人（經濟獨立）、結婚生子（身為父母，感同身受）等，作為關鍵事件，將孝道發展

分成不同階段，而這每一階段各有其獨特的孝道內涵，〈陰陽孝道論〉未考量這些人生

關鍵事件（其可能對孝道造成重大影響）。未來或能就這幾點缺失，持續深化〈陰陽孝

道論〉。

26

五、未來研究方向

  本文提出陰孝和孝道陰陽轉化概念，未來可做質性研究，訪談陰孝子女，詢問他們

父母在世時孝道態度，及喪親後心境轉折。接著，依據此探索資料，進一步編製「陰陽

孝道量表」。這裡以陰孝子女為樣本，陰孝量表沒問題，但陽孝量表可能有偏誤；因為

對陰孝子女而言，那些陽孝項目已是過去式，無法實踐，為回想情況，屬「虛」，所以

無法適用陽孝子女，故此量表為「虛陽孝量表」。也因此，應當另以陽孝子女為樣本編

制「實陽孝量表」。同時，對於陽孝子女而言，那些陰孝項目尚未發生，為假想情況，

亦屬「虛」，故能再編制「虛陰孝量表」。如此，便有「實陽孝」、「虛陽孝」、「實

陰孝」、「虛陰孝」四種量表，可依研究目的和對象權衡採用或相互比較。

  「群己共享孝道」的陰陽轉化較符合常理和事實，因失去至親，由愛轉悲，歉疚感

油生，乃人之常情。相較之下，「權威位階孝道」的轉化，由敬畏轉為悔悟、悔過，效

果由負轉正，道理似乎不那麼直接明瞭。本理論認為其轉化透過「解放」和「補償」，

以及「業法則」和「道道法則」的運作，該如何證實此點，殊為關鍵。

  以補償作用為例，其藉「為善去惡」和「化育萬物」回報死去父母，以弭平內心歉

疚感。佛教強調慈悲、利他，故可考慮先以佛教徒為樣本，分陽孝佛教徒和陰孝佛教徒

兩組，詢問其行善動機為何或主要迴向給誰；亦能設計題項讓他們選擇，例如迴向給有

情眾生、愛人、父母、朋友、宇宙萬物等，然後比較兩組差異。由於陽孝佛教徒父母尚

健在，可直接向父母盡孝道方式很多，補償作用基本無功能；相反，陰孝佛教徒父母已

往生，補償作用遂開始運作。因此，本理論預測陽孝佛教徒作善事較會迴向有情眾生，

陰孝佛教徒則較多迴向父母。此外，由於華人社會深受佛教影響，其教義如業報、迴向

廣被採納，因而亦能以非佛教徒為樣本。本理論同樣預測：相較於陽孝子女，陰孝子女

會較多迴向父母。

  除了量表施測，亦能使用促發研究（priming  study）。首先分陽孝子女和陰孝子女

兩組，請他們描述自己父母種種（促發父母組），或者描述與父母無關的中性人物（對

照組），此是 2×2 設計。然後再設計能讓參與者做出利他行為（捐錢或幫助人）的情境，

這是依變項。本理論預測有交互作用，促發父母組的利他行為會多於中性組，主要由陰

孝子女貢獻；這是因為陰孝子女對死去父母有歉疚感，故產生補償作用，表現在做善事，

但陽孝子女並無此心理機轉條件（因父母尚健在）。以上僅約略說明可行的實徵研究方

向。

總之，未來能基於〈陰陽孝道論〉，開展孝道研究，應特別著重在「陰孝」以及從

陽孝至陰孝的轉化歷程。本研究統整以往孝道研究和喪親研究有關正、負向效果的分歧

27

結果，並深化孝道概念，拓展孝道和喪親研究領域，希冀對本土社會科學（尤指本土諮

商心理學）有所貢獻。

Ying-Yang Filial Piety Theory

Jen-Hao Li*

Abstract

          This study adheres to the principle of "one mind, multiple mentalities" and adopts a dual

universality  approach  (transcendental  universality  and  empirical  universality).  It  uses  the

concept of Yin-Yang as a metaphysical presumption and a transcendental formal structure to

construct a universal and inclusive cultural theory, namely the "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory."

Filial piety is classified into "Yang filial piety" and "Yin filial piety," with the loss of parents

being a key event. Yang filial piety refers to filial piety practiced while parents are alive, while
Yin filial piety refers to filial piety practiced after the loss of parents. Here, "life and death" is

regarded as Yin and Yang respectively, where life represents Yang and death represents Yin.

The characteristics of life and death conform to the principles of Yin-Yang interdependence,

mutual  exclusion,  mutual  growth  and  decline,  and  mutual  transformation.  The  lack  of

consideration  for  Yin  filial  piety  in  filial  piety  research  is  a  major  shortcoming,  which  this

theory seeks to address. Drawing on the research of Alan Fiske, interpersonal relationships can

be categorized into communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching, and market pricing.

The first two can be applied to family relationships, leading to the two transcendental categories

of  filial  piety:  communal  sharing  filial  piety  and  authority  ranking  filial  piety.  Filial  piety

undergoes a transformation from  Yang to  Yin after the loss of parents.  In Yang filial piety,

communal  sharing  filial  piety  has  positive  effects  due  to  ingroup  favoritism  and  reciprocal

altruism, while authority ranking filial piety has negative effects due to status differentials and

resource exchange. After the loss of parents (Yin filial piety), communal  sharing filial piety

transitions from positive to negative due to feelings of loss and guilt, while authority ranking

filial  piety  transitions  from  negative  to  positive  through  liberation  and  compensation.  This

theory  integrates  previous  research  on  filial  piety  and  bereavement,  deepening  the

understanding of filial piety and expanding research in this field, particularly in the context of

indigenous social sciences, such as indigenous counseling psychology.

Keywords: communal sharing filial piety, Yin filial piety, Yang filial piety, bereavement of

parents, dual universality approach, authority ranking filial piety

I. Preface

Respecting filial piety is a characteristic of Chinese culture. It has a profound and broad

impact and is an essential issue in local social sciences (Lu, 2011; Yeh & Yang, 2008). Filial

piety  emphasizes  relationship,  context,  interaction,  process,  and  other  aspects  (process-

relational  perspective),  which  is  the  characteristic  and  core  concept  of  Eastern  culture  and

traditional philosophy. It differs from Western culture and mainstream science's static substance

perspective  and  methodological  individualism.  Wei  coincides  with  the  metaphysical

presupposition  or  ontology  implicit  in  the  relativity  theory  and  quantum  theory  of  modern

physics, which reveals the profound nature of the reality of things or social reality (Bedford &

Yeh,  2020;  Cheng,  2011).  Ontology  is  the  paradigm,  methodology,  and  epistemology

foundation  of  scientific  research  (Li,  2020);  therefore,  filial  piety  is  not  only  a  distinctive

research topic in indigenous social sciences but also plays a vital role in establishing universal

human psychology and moving from indigenization to globalization (Tsao & Yeh, 2019), or

how to follow the principle of "one mind, many mentalities; universalism without uniformity"

(Shweder et al., 2007). Based on the philosophy of science and integrating Chinese and Western

knowledge (Hwang, 2011), the study of filial piety is also inspiring and essential.

One  of  the  pioneers  of  filial  piety  research  in  indigenous  psychology  is  Guoshu  Yang

(1985). He referred to classics such as "The Four Books," "The Book of Rites," "The Classic

of Filial Piety," and famous family mottos. He also integrated relevant discussions on filial piety

from  humanities  scholars  to  integrate  15  connotations  of  filial  piety:  "respect  your  parents,

support your parents, obey your parents, advise your parents with reason, serve your parents

with etiquette, entertain your parents with the way, cherish your parents, be by your parent's

side, make your parents worry-free, take care of yourself, leave a descendant for your parents,

inherit  the  family  business,  honor  your  parents'  names,  and  bury  and  worship  parents  with

funeral rites." This lays a good foundation for the study of filial piety. One of the current major

Filial Piety Theories, "The Dual Filial Piety Model" (Bedford & Yeh, 2019; Yeh, 2003; Yeh &

Bedford,  2003),  is  based  on  the  specific  norms  of  filial  piety  established  by  Guoshu  Yang.

Although this theory is widely accepted and cited, it still has some imperfections. This article

proposes  the  "Yin-Yang  Filial  Piety  Theory"  to  compete  with  it.  According  to  Paul

Feyerabend's principle of pluralist methodological proliferation, even if a particular theory has

been highly confirmed and generally accepted, scientists should try their best to develop other

theories and engage in healthy competition to facilitate scientific development.

36

Perfecting  comprehensive  scientific  research  must  include  philosophical  reflection,

theoretical construction, and empirical research. The theoretical construction must meet several

norms or criteria of excellence: (1) Completeness: refers to its ability to expand the scope of

explanation  or  accommodate  more  phenomena;  (2)  Integrativeness:  puzzles  are  caused  by

inconsistent  or  contradictory  research  results.  This  is  a  common  phenomenon  in  academic

circles. The scientific community is most concerned about how to solve the puzzles; the theory

must provide a structure or explanation to integrate many divergent research data to solve the

puzzles;  (3)  Internal  consistency:  all  propositions  or  assumptions  within  the  theory  must  be

consistent  and  not  contradictory;    (4)  Verifiability:  hypotheses  can  be  derived  from  these

propositions  to  test  whether  they  are  right  or  wrong;  (5)  Contains  historical  and  cultural

interpretation: according to the epistemological philosophy of Jürgen Habermas, psychology is

both  an  empirical  analysis  discipline  and  a  historical  interpretation  discipline,  with  both

characteristics; however, the psychological field generally ignores the historical interpretation

component, and local social sciences should pay more attention to this part;    (6) Symmetry,

simplicity  and  even  beauty:  Although  this  is  not  necessary,  it  is  essential  when  judging  the

quality  of  a  theory.  Especially  symmetry  is  an  important  scientific  principle,  and  many

phenomena follow the law of symmetry (Hargittai & Hargittai, 1994). The beauty derived from

symmetry and simplicity motivates many scientists to seek natural laws, and Albert Einstein is

one of them (Isaacson, 2007).

"Yin-Yang  Filial  Piety  Theory"  is  more  complete  than  "The  Dual  Filial  Piety  Model."

Most studies on filial piety focus on the filial piety performed by children while their parents

are  still  alive,  with  little  mention  of  filial  piety  after  bereavement.  In  fact,  there  are  many

elements of filial piety practiced after bereavement. As Yeh (2005, p. 293) said: "Filial piety

does  not  only  mean  that  children  are  good  at  raising  their  parents,  but  its  scope  gradually

increases and expands, for example, inheritance the legacy of ancestors is also called filial piety,

and the mourning of parents is also called filial piety; therefore, honoring parents is not limited

to parents while they are alive, but can also continue after parents die." Unfortunately, The Dual

Filial Piety Model rarely focuses on this, so its completeness is slightly lacking. Looking at the

connotations of Yang's 15 filial piety items, the filial piety items practiced by parents during

their  lifetime  include  "advise  your  parents  with  reason,  serve  your  parents  with  etiquette,

entertain your parents with the way, make your parents worry-free, and be by your parent's side,

and  support  your  parents"  6  items  can  be  described  as  "Yang  filial  piety".  There  are  two

practical projects after the death of parents: "bury parents with etiquette and worship parents

with etiquette", which can be called "Yin filial piety". As for the other seven items, "respect

37

your parents, obey your parents, inherit the family business, honor your parents' names, cherry

your parents, take care of yourself, and leave a descendant for your parents", it goes no matter

whether  the  parents  are  alive  or  dead.  Practice  lasts  throughout  life,  which  can  be  called

"lifelong filial piety". It can be seen from this that many elements of filial piety last throughout

one's life. It does not mean that filial piety ends after a bereavement or that it is just a matter of

offering sacrifices in memory. This theory covers Yang filial piety and Yin filial piety (both

lifelong filial piety), among which the introduction of Yin filial piety is a feature of this theory.

Although psychological research has extensively explored the psychology and behavior of

children after bereavement, most of them are not related to filial piety. In addition, bereavement

research results are quite mixed and even contradictory, suggesting that bereavement can have

both positive and negative effects on children. For example, bereavement increases children's

susceptibility to  disease  and increases  the risk of depression,  anxiety, hopelessness,  suicidal

thoughts, attempts or behaviors, and death (Latham & Prigerson, 2004; Rostila & Saarela, 2011).

The above are negative effects. Some studies have also pointed out that bereavement can bring

positive  effects  (Dahlberg,  2020;  Rostila  &  Saarela,  2011).  For  example,  bereavement  can

contributes to children’s maturity (Davies, 1991) or understand the meaning of life (Brewer &

Sprakes, 2011); people with an IQ score above 155 are three times more likely to be bereaved

early  in  life  than  expected  (Albert,  1971),  or  those  who  are  recognized  as  accomplished

(according  to  Encyclopedia  Britannica)  are  more  likely  to  be  bereaved  early  in  life  than

expected (Eisenstadt, 1978). This is the puzzle of bereavement research. The study of filial piety

is  similar. Yeh (2009) and Yeh (2003) compiled and analyzed that filial  piety will have the

following positive effects on children, such as character traits that are helpful for interpersonal

interaction,  such  as  friendliness,  rigor,  harmony,  humanity,  etc.;  promoting  emotional

connection between parents and children or Family cohesion; reduce the frequency of parent-

child conflicts; make adult children willing to provide parents with emotional, financial, labor

and other support. At the same time, filial piety can also have negative effects on children, such

as  making  children  develop  repressive,  obedient,  and  conservative  characters,  or  reducing

psychological flexibility, creativity, and self-expression ability, or parents' filial piety attitude

is negatively correlated with children's cognitive complexity, etc. This is the puzzle of filial

piety research. Under the "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory" framework, this puzzle can be solved,

and  the  many  inconsistent  results  of  bereavement  research  and  filial  piety  research  can  be

unified.

In  addition,  bereavement  research  focuses  on  the  grief  process  and  developmental

maladaptation of children and rarely touches on the deeper psychological mechanisms of mood

38

transformation and life transformation. Even if it does, filial piety is hardly mentioned.  Or if

filial piety is mentioned only briefly without any further investigation. At the same time, there

are few perspectives on morality, religion, culture, etc. (such as apology, guilt, gratitude, and

other moral  senses,  or religious  beliefs such as transcendence, life  and death,  suffering, and

enlightenment).  For  example,  Tang  and  Li  (2019)  explored  the  psychological  process  of

Chinese college students after the death of their parents suffered from cancer and found four

main components: (1) Facing significant  changes in  life, including three sub-components of

negative  reactions:  denial,  avoidance  of  death,  and  drastic  changes  in  life  order;  (2)  The

experience of loss and grief, including three sub-components: acceptance of the fact of death,

deep feeling of unfilial piety, and intense feelings of losing a loved one; (3) Life challenges and

coping methods after bereavement, including four sub-components: grief and loneliness, loss

of instrumental social support, loss of emotional social support, and coping strategies; (4) Re-

understanding  death,  including  the  two  sub-components:  rationalizing  death  and  giving

meaning to life. There are only two brief mentions of filial piety in the text. One is "deep sense

of  unfilial  piety",  which  points  out  that  Confucian  cultural  norms  can  easily  cause  children

(especially sons) to feel enormously guilty. The other is "giving life meaning", pointing out that

Confucian  culture  provides  a  moral  foundation  with  filial  piety,  and  the  ultimate  goal  is  to

enable life to  end well and successfully. These two points have indeed pointed out  the core

concept of "Yin filial piety". Unfortunately, the text does not discuss filial piety in detail and

depth, there is little historical and cultural explanation, and it does not cite the theory of filial

piety for a unified explanation. Given the above, this article hopes to make up for the lack of

research on bereavement, starting from the moral, religious, and cultural levels, focusing on the

deep psychological mechanisms such as the transformation of children's mood and even the

transformation of life after bereavement, and trying to connect filial piety. Yin-Yang Filial Piety

Theory can meet the theoretical specifications of completeness, integrativeness, and inclusion

of historical interpretation. It can also meet internal consistency, verifiability, symmetry, or the

principle of parsimony.

II. Methodology and Ontological Stance

1. Religious Agnosticism and Pragmatism

Most of the Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory involves Yin Filial Piety. It contains religious

elements, but it must be clarified that these religious concepts (such as karma, afterlife, ghosts,

39

gods, and God) are only psychological constructs. This study does not conclude whether there

is  a  transcendent  existence  (objective  reality).  In  essence,  this  is  a  matter  of  faith  or  moral

practice, which is "should be" and is difficult to test with "actual" scientific methods. However,

religious believers believe that the transcendent realm and its operating mechanism do exist and

that  psychological  reality  can  regulate  personal  actions.  Therefore,  religion-related  research

should be regarded as symbolic realism, as suggested by Bellah (1970).

Regarding methodology, Berger (1967) believed that Methodological Atheism should be

adhered to; however, there are many problems with this idea (Porpora, 2006) and it may be

more appropriate to embrace Methodological Agnosticism (Smart, 1973). From the perspective

of Pragmatism, it is not necessary to ask what "reality" is, but it is more important to ask why

its role, function, or benefit. For example, the father of American psychology, William James

(2022), believes that the purpose of religion is not God but life, a broader, richer, and more

satisfying  life;  or  the  so-called  "existence"  is  to  create  differences,  whether  the  object  of

religious belief exists or not, to see whether He can change people (Fu, 2018). According to

this, whether you believe it or not depends on the effect, which is the most important, and many

studies have shown that religious belief has positive benefits for mental health and happiness

(Levin, 2010).

2. Dual Universality Approach

In response to the methodological problem of "how to construct a Universal and Inclusive

Cultural Theory", Li (2023) based on the transcendental structure and two-step epistemological

strategy  proposed  by  Hwang  (2019),  from  a  philosophical  approach  (New  Realism,  Kant's

transcendental  philosophy,  Structuralism)  and  scientific  approaches  (evolutionary  theory,

perception,  cognition,  and  neuropsychology),  proposing  a  "double  universal  approach"  to

confirm  that  we  understand  things  through  agnosia  (taking  prosopagnosia  as  an  example)

(Recognizing objects) There are two key steps. (1) apperceptive recognition: there is a priori

formal  structure  first,  which  is  higher  than  the  previous  level;  (2)  associative  recognition:

putting the sensory material of external things into a priori formal structure and then connecting

it to acquired knowledge, memory, and names to generate meaning, which is a later stage (Bruce

& Young, 2012; Farah, 2004; Hole & Bourne, 2010). This basic perceptual cognitive process

with epistemological implications is transferred to methodology, which shows that if you want

to construct a Universal and Inclusive Cultural Theory, you must first establish "transcendental

universality",  and  then  you  can  concrete  it  through  culture.  The  connotation  connects  the

40

transcendental formal structure to achieve empirical universality. Transcendental universality

can  be  established  through  number,  form,  and  transcendental  categories,  while  empirical

universality can be achieved through cross-cultural, developmental, and longitudinal research.

There is also the comparative psychology approach, which can establish empirical universality

and  connect  transcendental  universality.  To  search  for  the  universal  human  mind  from  an

evolutionary perspective, we cannot examine humans alone. Still, we should also look at the

close  relatives  of  humans,  such  as  great  apes  (such  as  chimpanzees,  baboons,  gorillas,

orangutans, etc.). For example, research shows that the ability to recognize faces is not unique

to  humans  (innate,  specialized  brain  areas,  different  from  other  object  recognition),  and  the

same is true for many animals (especially primates) (Pascalis & Kelly, 2009), which shows that

face  recognition  is  not  unique  to  humans.  Ability  comes  from  phylogenesis,  so  it  has

transcendental universality.

The "number" of the transcendental formal structure is not only a methodology but also

the basis and evidence for quantitative research. It is also considered to be the reality or origin

of things. For example, the Pythagoras school advocates that "everything is number." Using

"numbers" to represent or construct the phenomenal world or the real world has always been

the approach of natural science (Stewart, 1997). "Shape" is also essential in natural phenomena

and scientific theories (Hildebrandt & Tromba, 1985), and various shapes or polyhedrons have

their symbolic meanings and are universal (Lundy, 2002). Examples of the use of "form" in

social sciences, such as the "Mandala Model of Self," which uses an inner circle and an outer

square (Hwang, 2011), and the "Psychodynamic Model of Self," which uses a tetragonal solid

and an octahedron (Hwang, 2018). "Shape" is a transcendental formal structure, so any concept

or specific item that conforms to the symbolic meaning of a circle, a square, a tetrahedron, or

an  octahedron  can  be  placed.  "Transcendental  categories"  are  derived  from  the  Table  of

Categories in Kant's epistemological philosophy, and transcendental universality extends it to

the "transcendental categories of things" that coordinate or standardize things. It is stored in the

psychological archetype of the evolutionary history of the species and belongs to the collective

subconscious of the species. Most of it can be obtained without experience. Because it is beyond

culture, it is universal. For example, animals classify things as "food vs. non-food," "danger vs.

safety,"  "our  group vs. another  group,"  "same-sex vs. opposite sex," "sexual  signal  vs. non-

sexual  signal,"  etc.  (Lakoff,  1987).  There  are  also  culture-inclusive  categories  that  are  not

transcendental.  These  psychological  stereotypes  stored  in  ontogenesis  belong  to  the  cultural

collective subconscious. They refer to the categories of things individuals have acquired from

being  immersed  in  a  particular  culture  since  birth  and  are  often  taken  for  granted,  Such  as

41

Confucianism's "the Five Cardinal Relationships", etc. However, because culture is subject to

experience  and  time  and  space  context,  it  is  not  necessarily  universal.  The  content  of

"transcendental  categories"  sometimes  overlaps  with  "culture-inclusive  categories"  and  is

difficult to distinguish.

It must be emphasized that although the transcendental formal structure is a form and has

no  content,  it  is  rooted  in  the  evolutionary  history  of  the  species  and  comes  from  the

"experience" of long-term evolutionary selection of species. The same principle is transferred

to methodology. The transcendental formal structure (referred to as "transcendental category")

set in the first step of the dual universality approach can also come from "experience". In other

words, the results can be obtained through literature review, content analysis, meta-analysis or

factor analysis, and serve as a tentative "transcendental category". In the second step, you can

incorporate cultural phenomena or content that conforms to its elements; or you can incorporate

other cultural content, examine their similarities and differences, and further seek to achieve

universality. As for using "number" and "shape" as transcendental formal structures, this is a

purer form and is not based on induction, content analysis, meta-analysis, or factor analysis.

However, just like the transcendental categories, "number" and "shape," It can also incorporate

phenomena  that  meet  its  elements.  A  Universal  and  Inclusive  Cultural  Theory  can  be

constructed following the above steps.

A general rule is: the a priori formal structure set in the first step of the dual universality

approach is not testable. What can be tested is the specific content incorporated in the second

step according to  the a  priori  formal structure.  For  example, if  "number" is  used as  a priori

formal structure, what needs to be verified is not the "number" itself, but specific matters. If it

is found that the test results do not conform to the derivation results of the mathematical system,

there are two possibilities. One is wrong in observing conditions or experimental processes or

citing  theories;  the  other  is  using  the  wrong  mathematical  system  and  other  mathematical

systems should be tried. There are so many mathematical systems, some of which correspond

to the phenomenal world, and some of which are not certain. It must be reminded that no matter

numbers, shapes or categories, they are all temporary and not absolute. According to the depth

ontology  of  critical  realism,  each  level  of  stratified  reality  may  produce  emergent  qualities

(Bhaskar, 1975, 1978), and the underlying transcendental formal structure of numbers, shapes,

and  categories  may  change  accordingly.  Finally,  the  first  step  not  only  has  ontological

implications, but can also be viewed as a methodological strategy. Laudan (1981) believes that

the philosophy of science is divided into two major departments: the conceptual basis of science

(such  as  philosophy  of  physics,  philosophy  of  biology)  and  scientific  methodology  theory,

42

which is  further divided  into validation and heuristics. The vast  majority  of research is  of a

validation approach, focusing on the testing principles that govern the theory. Heuristic rules

focus on how to expand the scope of application of a theory, or what empirical methods can

help discover new theories, and are deeply rooted in the spirit of pragmatism. The first step can

be regarded as a heuristic method, which belongs to the general research framework that guides

research and inspires inspiration. It does not belong to the verification method. The second step

is.

" Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory " adopts a dual universality approach, follows the "priority

principle  of  transcendental  universality",  and  first  establishes  a  priori  formal  structure

(transcendental  categories  of  things)  and  innate  knowledge  to  make  it  have  transcendental

universality; subsequent research Through various practical research methods, the universality

of practical research can be achieved.

3. The Yin and Yang of Transcendental Formal Structure

Anthropologist Lévi-Strauss (1976) investigated the thinking patterns of various cultures

and found a common phenomenon of binary classification. This duality is the transcendental

formal structure. Although both Eastern and Western cultures contain duality, Western culture

places  greater  emphasis  on  the  binary  opposite.  In  contrast,  Chinese  culture's  "Yin-Yang

ontology"  is  based  on  binary  coexistence.  Using  a  physics  metaphor  to  illustrate,  binary

opposition is similar to an electric charge. Positive or negative charges can exist independently

and do not need to depend on each other to exist. Binary coexistence is identical to two magnetic

poles (polarity). The South Pole and the North Pole are always in pairs. They appear dually and

cannot  exist  independently  (Gamow,  2005).  Therefore,  this  is  the  most  critical  difference

between the two.

The theory of Yin and Yang penetrates all aspects of Chinese culture and is considered the

source of the great truth. It can be said to be the deep structure of Chinese culture, which is

reflected  in  natural  subjects  (astronomy,  calendar,  meteorology),  practical  technology

(agriculture, medicine, architecture, Feng Shui), and artistic aesthetics (calligraphy, painting),

martial arts, Tai Chi) at all levels. Yin and Yang are in name only but not in reality. The Book

of Changes says, "One Yin and one yang are called Tao." It also says, "What is metaphysical is

called Tao, and what is metaphysical is called tool." It can be seen that Yin and Yang are out-

and-out  metaphysical  concepts,  with  the  deep  meaning  of  "emptiness"  it  has  the  wonderful

function of unifying and accommodating all things and is regarded as the origin of all things.

43

"Yellow  Emperor's  Internal  Classic/Suwen  /Yin-Yang  Yinxiang  theory"  says  that  "Yin  and

Yang are the way of heaven and earth, the order of all things, the parents of change, and the

origin of life and death," and "Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic/Su Wen/Yin-Yang Separation

Theory"  says,  "Yin  and  Yang  can  be  counted  by  ten,  can  be  counted  by  hundreds,  can  be

counted by thousands, can be counted by tens of thousands, and can be counted by countless

numbers, but the principle is the same." This means that all things originate from the union. Yin

and  Yang  take  them  together.  Yin  and  Yang  are  a  transcendental  formal  structure  with

transcendental  universality  because  it  has  three  forms  of  expression:  number,  shape,  and

category,  as  well  as  five  structural  characteristics  such  as  integrity,  transformation,  self-

regulation,  dynamic  equilibrium,  and  symmetry.  In  "number,"  that  is,  the  binary  (0,  1)

arithmetic, or the black and white calculation of "Hetu, Luoshu". In terms of "shape" or "image",

for example, Tai Chi Diagram or various hexagrams and lines in the "Book of Changes" are

used to draw analogies to images. "Category" refers to using Yin and Yang to govern things. In

addition, a lot of "inclusive cultural knowledge" can also be deduced from the theory of Yin

and Yang, but this is not necessarily universal, such as men being superior to women, etc.

There  are  roughly  four  characteristics  or  dynamic  laws  of  Yin  and  Yang:  mutual  roots,

mutual  exclusion,  mutual  growth  and  decline,  and  mutual  transformation.  Its  mechanism  is

dynamic equilibrium, the balance of Yin and Yang. Mutual rooting is the most fundamental

characteristic of Yin and Yang, mutual growth and decline and mutual transformation are the

dynamic development of Yin and Yang, and mutual exclusion has both static properties and

dynamic development. The following elucidates these points:

(1) Mutual roots: This means that they are two sides of one body; one cannot exist without

the other, and they coexist. That is, "there is Yang in Yin, and there is Yin in Yang" and "Yang

cannot grow alone, and Yin alone cannot grow."

(2) Mutually exclusiveness: refers to opposite properties, such as men and women, cold and

heat,  dryness  and  dampness,  inside  and  outside,  left  and  right,  good  and  evil,  beauty  and

ugliness, positive and negative spin, positive energy and negative energy, particles, and anti-

particles, etc. It also refers to mutual repulsion, which is caused by interaction to produce action

and reaction forces. Mutual roots and mutual repulsion make Yin and Yang inseparable and

push each other; although they are mutually exclusive, they cannot exist independently without

each other.

(3) Mutual  growth  and  decline:  Only  when there is  mutual  repulsion can Yin and Yang

move, and only then can they mutually increase and decrease, that is, "one decreases and the

44

other increases, and one increases and the other decreases." This is a dynamic development of

quantitative change.

(4) Mutual transformation: Too much growth on one side or too much weakening on the

other will lead to mutual transformation. It is said that "heavy Yin must be Yang, heavy Yang

must be Yin" and "the extremes of things must be reversed." This is the most extreme change

of Yin and Yang. This stage will lead to another type of Yin and Yang and dynamic equilibrium

mechanism or form another cycle that starts over and over again. This is a dynamic development

of qualitative change.

III. Overview of "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory"

1.  Two  Major  Transcendental  Categories  of  Filial  Piety:  Sharing  Among  Others  and

Authority Level

Filial  piety  has  positive  and  negative  effects,  implying  that  filial  piety  has  at  least  two

operational components. The most reasonable and concise guesses are two, which are also the

most symmetrical. One produces a positive effect, and the other produces a negative effect. Of

course,  this  is  not  absolute,  but  there  is  Yang  within  Yin,  and  Yin  within  yang.  It  is  very

reasonable to infer the essential reality of things through effects or functions. This is the core

concept of pragmatism. So, what are the two components?

Yang et al. (1989) wrote 52 questions based on the connotations of Yang's (1985) 15 items

of filial piety as a conceptual framework and measurement tool to verify filial piety. Through

exploratory factor analysis of these 52 items, four components were obtained: "Respect parents

and sincere parents," "Support and offer sacrifices to parents," "Suppress oneself and submit to

parents," and "Protect parents and honor parents." In addition, Yeh (1997) studied the changes

in  the  concept  of  filial  piety  among  Taiwanese  people  and  selected  three  representative

questions from each of these four components. After text modification, pre-testing, and deleting

questions through the survey, nine questions were finally obtained; these nine questions were

verified. Factor analysis found that there are higher-order components. One group is "respecting

parents, sincerely supporting parents, supporting and offering sacrifices" (correlation is as high

as .85), and the other group is "restraining oneself and obeying parents, protecting parents and

honoring parents" (correlation is also up to .85). According to the purpose of his research, Yeh

calls the former "the core concept of filial piety" and the latter "the changing concept of filial

piety."

45

Confucianism  believes  interpersonal  relationships  include  father  and  son,  monarch  and

minister, husband and wife, brothers and friends. The Five Cardinal Relationships are classified

according to two criteria. First, consanguinity: fathers, sons, and brothers are one category if

they  have  a  blood  basis,  while  monarchs,  ministers,  and  friends  are  not  another  category;

although there is no blood relationship between husband and wife, they are the starting point of

blood ties, which is a necessary condition. Second, authority ranking: fathers and sons, brothers,

monarchs, and ministers with obvious superiority and inferiority are in one category, friends

are in another category, and couples look at patriarchal society, matriarchal society, or modern

society (emphasis on equality and human rights) differently. The Five Cardinal Relationships

dyad  interaction  law,  derived  from  blood  relatives  (benevolence;  loving  psychology)  and

authority rank (righteousness; appropriate behavior), is "the principle of favoring the intimate"

and "the principle of reverencing the superior," such as "The Doctrine of the Mean." "Chapter

20"  says,  "Benevolent  is  a  human  being,  and  being  close  to  relatives  is  the  greatest;

righteousness  is  appropriate,  and  respecting  the  virtuous  is  the  greatest."  "The  differential

treatment  of  relatives,  respecting  the  virtuous,  etc.,  is  born  of  etiquette."  Its  "differential

treatment  of  closeness"  is  on  the  principle  of  favoring  the  intimate,  and  "respecting  the

virtuous." is on the principle of reverencing the superior.

The  Five  Cardinal  Relationships  should  be  centered  on  father-son  (parent-child

relationship) and couple (spousal relationship) because these two relationships are necessary

conditions for the continuation of the family lifeline or the transmission of personal genes. On

the other hand, kings, ministers, brothers, and friends have nothing to do with the reproduction

of life and are dispensable. Still, they are beneficial to the operation and evolution of society.

The  parent-child  relationship  is  more  unique  and  meaningful  than  the  relationship  between

husband and wife, which is reflected in three aspects.

First, blood relationship: The parent-child relationship is eternal, destined, unchangeable,

exclusive, and unique. It is the earliest interpersonal relationship that occurs (starts at birth) and

lasts  the  longest  (throughout  a  lifetime).  The  relationship  between  husband  and  wife  begins

after adulthood. It is a chance encounter. It is not destined, can be changed, and is not exclusive.

Second, belonging to our group: An individual’s genes come from half of his parents, and

he is the closest to them in the world and most similar to themselves, so his belonging to his

group is the strongest. The group affiliation of a husband and wife is not as strong as the parent-

child  relationship.  It  can  only  be  combined  through  similarities  (appearance,  ethnic  group,

language,  class,  occupation,  religious  beliefs,  political  leanings,  personality,  interests,

geography, etc.). If they get along day and night, the group affiliation will strengthen.

46

Third, the authority level: In the parent-child relationship, parents have a higher authority

status  and  more  resources  than  their  children  (adult  children  are  another  matter).  The

relationship between husband and wife is undecided.

Based on the above, "belonging to our group" (including blood, geography, similarity, and

other factors) and "authority level" are the core components of the parent-child relationship so

that they can be regarded as the category of filial piety. Their corresponding "the principle of

favoring  the  intimate"  and  "the  principle  of  reverencing  the  superior"  can  be  the  operating

mechanism.  This  is  based  on  the  interpretation  of  specific  historical  culture,  so  its  cultural

categories and mechanisms are not necessarily universal but only potential.

Sociologist Alan Fiske (1991) reviewed a large amount of anthropology, sociology, and

psychology  literature  and  pointed  out  four  types  of  "universal"  interpersonal  interaction

relationships: communal sharing, authority hierarchy, equality matching, and market pricing.

Among them, "communal sharing" corresponds to the emotional relationship and the law of

demand (Sundararajan, 2015) in the "Theoretical Model of Face and Favor" (Hwang, 1987).

This belongs to the family relationship, so it can also correspond to the group's belonging and

the analysis of Confucian historical interpretation. The principle of favoring the intimate. For

this reason, "communal sharing" can be the universal transcendental category of filial piety. In

addition,  "authority  ranking"  corresponds  entirely  to  this,  so  it  can  be  used  as  another

transcendental category of filial piety. As for equal matching and market valuation, it mainly

applies  to  acquaintances (mixed relationships,  the law of Favor) and strangers (instrumental

relationships,  the  law  of  fairness),  and  does  not  involve  family  relationships  (Sundararajan,

2015). According to this, "shared by others" and "authority level" are two a priori categories of

filial piety, which can be used to coordinate "respecting relatives, offering sacrifices to relatives,

restraining oneself and obeying relatives, protecting relatives and honoring relatives" including

cultural norms and many other inner connotations of filial piety.

Finally, "communal sharing filial piety" roughly corresponds to the mutual filial piety of

"The Dual  Filial Piety  Model," while "authoritative filial piety" corresponds to  authoritative

filial piety. However, the foundations of "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory" and "The Dual Filial

Piety Model" differ. The former adopts a dual universality approach; the latter is a historical

analysis  across  Chinese  dynasties,  summarizing  the  historical  development  of  filial  piety  in

three  stages:  the  pre-Qin  period  (reciprocal  filial  piety  has  the  relative  advantage),  the  Han

Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty (authoritative filial piety dominates), and the early Republic of

China. So far (traditional and modern multiple presentations), a reconceptualization of filial

piety  psychology  from  the  deep  structure  of  the  parent-child  relationship  has  finally  been

47

supported by factor analysis results (Yeh, 2003, 2009). In addition, this theory emphasizes that

reciprocal filial piety and authoritative filial piety are by no means mutually exclusive but are

positively  correlated  to  a  moderate  degree  (Yeh,  2009);  both  contain  positive  and  negative

effects, but the former is more positive, and the latter is more negative. (Tsao & Yeh, 2019). In

other words, reciprocal filial piety and authoritative filial piety achieve similar family functional

demands  through  two  different  psychological  operation  pathways:  treating  parents  well  and

maintaining family harmony (Tsao & Yeh, 2017; Yeh, 2017). These arguments are consistent

with  the  "Yin-Yang  Filial  Piety  Theory"  because  Yin  and  Yang  are  not  inherently  dualistic

(independent and self-existing) but dualistic coexistence, and the operating mechanism of Yin

and Yang are dynamic equilibrium, with the ultimate direction being harmony. Finally, "The

Dual Filial Piety Model" also follows the principle of "one mind, many mentalities," is both

universal  and  encompasses  culture  or  contains  both  the  individual's  universal  psychological

level (contextualized personality construct) and Collective cultural level (Bedford & Yeh, 2019;

Tsao & Yeh, 2019). This point is also consistent with the different approaches of this theory.

2. The Definition of "Yang Filial Piety" and "Yin Filial Piety"

Although "shared filial piety" and "filial piety of authority level" have a Yin and Yang

relationship  with  each  other,  which  conform  to  the  characteristics  of  mutual  roots,  mutual

exclusion, mutual growth and decline, and mutual transformation (explained later), their Yin

and Yang relationship  will  change  after the loss  of a parent.  Thus, it is unclear and easy to

confuse which one should be designated Yin or Yang. Therefore, this theory does not give the

title  of  Yin  and  Yang  to  "shared  filial  piety  among  the  group"  and  "filial  piety  of  authority

level." It only shows the essence of Yin and Yang, which is true but not named. The so-called

"Yang  filial  piety"  in  this  theory  refers  to  the  filial  piety  performed  by  children  when  their

parents are still alive, while the filial piety performed by children after the death of their parents

is called "Yin filial piety." Here, "life and death" are regarded as Yin and Yang; life is Yang,

and death is Yin; the characteristics of life and death conform to the principles of mutual rooting,

mutual exclusion, growth and decline, and transformation of Yin and Yang.

First of all, where there is life, there is death, and where there is death, there is life. Nothing

is  eternal,  and  people  are  certainly  no  exception.  In  addition,  according  to  the  First  law  of

thermodynamics, the "law of conservation of energy," after things die, they will be converted

into other forms of energy and continue to exist in the universe, opening up another kind of

48

"life" or "existence," regardless of the energy (existence) What is the form? Therefore, where

there is death, there is life. This is a mutual root.

Furthermore,  all  mortals  are  greedy  for  life  and  afraid  of  death,  and  life  and  death  are

mutually exclusive in nature. On this side, people have the instinctive motivation to survive; on

the other side, death is also a fateful pull. Martin Heidegger said that death is the only thing

people can be sure about in the future. Therefore, when "Dasein; being-there or being-in-the-

world" regards death as the manifestation of existence and regards death as the manifestation

of existence, anxiety arises When nothingness is the total support of existence (Chan, 2006).

The  fundamental  anxiety  of  human  existence  is  based  on  the  contradictory  opposition  and

mutual pull between life and death. This is mutually exclusive.

Finally, all things have a process of formation, existence, destruction, and emptiness, and

people also have a process of birth, old age, illness, and death; any existence or life tends to

emptiness  or  death.  From  birth  to  death,  the  process  is  like  the  waxing,  waning,  and

transformation  of  Yin  and  Yang.  According  to  the  analogy  between  nature  and  man  (the

isomorphism of nature and man), human life is like the year's four seasons. After the winter

solstice, the yang energy begins to  grow, and the Yin energy gradually disappears; after the

summer solstice, the yang energy reaches its peak and declines, and the Yin energy gradually

grows longer; back to the winter solstice, the Yang energy is exhausted, and the year is over,

and the cycle begins again. A year is spent in the waxing and waning of Yin and Yang, and

finally ends with transformation, starting another beginning. The same is true in human life.

Based on the above, theoretically, Yin and Yang can be used to control life and death.

"Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory" believes that bereavement triggers a developmental break

and  causes  a  qualitative  change  in  filial  piety.  Most  children  experience  bereavement  in

adulthood  and  less  often  in  adolescence;  however,  most  studies  focus  on  the  latter's

bereavement experience, which may be because bereavement will have a more significant or

negative  impact  on  underage  children.  Minor  children  lose  emotional,  financial,  material,

educational, and other support due to the disappearance of their primary resource providers. At

the same time, they are not psychologically prepared for the death of their parents, their parents'

death is unnatural, they have fewer or immature coping strategies, and they have less social

support, and have a more significant and negative impact on physical and mental health and

adaptive development (Li et al., 2003; Maier & Lachman, 2000). In comparison, adult children

have more support from various resources, are more psychologically prepared for the death of

their parents, most of the deaths of parents are natural deaths, and have more or mature coping

49

strategies, so the impact is more minor and less harmful (Dahlberg, 2020; Umberson & Chen,

1994).

Because adults have more chances of bereavement than children (it is more typical), and

considering that this study focuses on the moral, religious, and cultural aspects of filial piety,

adults’ moral and religious psychological behaviors are more mature than children and are more

profoundly influenced by culture, so adult children are used The bereavement experience is the

main one; however, we will also refer to the bereavement experience of minor children, because

the bereavement experience not only affects adaptation and development, and manifests many

mental problems (Dowdney, 2000), but also lasts into adulthood and even throughout life, and

has a profound and extensive impact. (Berg et al., 2016; Finkelstein, 1988). Understanding the

influencing or regulating factors will benefit the construction of this theory.

IV. Yang Filial Piety

The emotional foundation of Yang filial piety is "respect." Here, we adopt the concept of

"family resemblance" similar to that of Ludwig Wittgenstein; the various emotions of joy, anger,

sadness, joy, love, disgust, desire, worry, panic, and fear are not mutually exclusive. Instead,

they are blended and infiltrated, just like feelings of sadness and joy, surprise, etc. According

to this, the emotional effect cannot be judged from a single emotion but depends on what it

combines.  Regarding  " reverence,  "its connotation  can include love, admiration, admiration,

awe, etc. Combined with "love," the distance is shortened, and "respect and love" refer to love,

admiration, and closeness, and the effect is positive. If combined with "fear," it means distance,

and "reverence" refers to fear, admiration, and alienation, and the effect is negative. Yang filial

piety is based on the contradictory emotions of respect, love and reverence, aloofness, push-

pull, and rejection (Table 1).

1. Yang Filial Piety Shared by the Group

The inner connotations of the filial piety shared by the  group are "respect & be kind to

parents" and "serve parents". The former is lifelong filial piety (both Yang filial piety and Yin

filial piety), and the latter includes support (Yang filial piety) and sacrifice (Yin filial piety),

because the memorial ceremony is not suitable for everyone to share the Yang filial piety, so I

left it. The specific connotation of shared filial piety is "respect & be kind to parents" and "serve

parents". Its emotional basis is respect and love. Why do you love, admire, and be close to your

parents? There are roughly two sources of power and operating mechanisms.

  (1) Ingroup Favoritism

This stems from the fact that everyone loves themselves and that parents and children are

flesh and blood. Most people have egocentrism, egoism, self-positivity bias, the better-than-

average effect, and self-enhancement (Alicke & Govorun, 2005; Korn et al., 2012; Sedikides

& Gregg, 2008). From oneself to all things belonging to oneself (such as surname, first name,

residence,  group,  ethnic  group,  etc.),  the  more  similar  they  are  to  oneself,  the  closer  the

psychological distance is, the more attracted and loved they will be (Balliet et al., 2014; Leyens

et  al.,  2000);  the  less  one  is  like  oneself,  the  greater  the  psychological  distance,  the  more

rejection,  the  less  love  or  even  hate,  and  even  dehumanization  (Haslam,  2015).  This

psychological mechanism differentiates between people and me or between my group and other

groups (outgroup). In addition to being genetically derived from their parents and having the

closest  blood  relationship,  children  live  and  live  with  their  parents  since  birth  and  are  also

geographically  closest  to  each  other.  Nature  plus  nurture  has  the  most  profound  impact.

Therefore, my parents are the strongest among our group, the most attached, the closest, and

the  most  beloved.  The  operating  mechanism  of  filial  piety  that  our  group  prefers  is  "the

principle of favoring the intimate," and its connotation or norm is "respect & be kind to parents."

(2) Reciprocal Altruism

According  to  evolutionary  biology  analysis,  animals  behave  altruistically  because  the

other party has given them benefits, and they expect to be rewarded for their efforts (Trivers,

1971). Indeed, animals generally like and get close to those who have cared for or helped them

and then want to repay their kindness (Brosnan & de Wall, 2002). This is called "reciprocal

altruism" and applies to strangers and acquaintances (Trivers, 2010). Altruism among relatives

is called "kin selection," which is done regardless of the cost to pass on one's own or the group's

51

genes (Hamilton, 1964). Relatives generally choose parents who love their children (the way

of loving kindness). Filial piety should be based on reciprocity and altruism based on charity

(selection  of  relatives);  the  parent-child  relationship  interacts  in  pairs,  and  filial  piety  and

charity cannot be divided into two. There is no doubt that parents' kindness, dedication, and

even sacrifices for their children are unparalleled. Therefore, children are most grateful, admire

their parents, and are naturally willing to repay their kindness. The operating mechanism of

reciprocal and altruistic filial piety is "the repay principle," its connotation or norm is "serve

parents."  In  addition,  reciprocal  altruism  promotes  mutual  aid  and  cooperation,  and  mutual

assistance and collaboration also have evolutionary adaptive advantages (Tomasello & Vaish,

2013) and can achieve "harmonious coexistence."

2. Yang Filial Piety in the Authority Position

The connotation of authority-level filial piety is "suppress oneself and obey parents" and

"protect and honor parents," both of which are lifelong filial piety, so it can be generally used

as authority-level Yang filial piety. Its emotional basis is awe. Why do we fear, admire, and

alienate our parents? There are also two sources of power and operating mechanisms.

(1) Status of Superiority or Inferiority

The word "filial piety" means from the old to the son, and its shape is from the top to the

bottom, showing the order of superiority and inferiority in the upper and lower ranks. Those in

a superior position have the power to instruct those in a subordinate position, so the children in

a subordinate position will have feelings of humiliation, admiration, and even fear towards their

superior parents and a sense of distance. In contrast, parents in a superior position will have

feelings of respect and authority for their children in a lower position and will also have a sense

of distance. The desire for power, control, or autonomy is a basic human need. Parents control

the power. If their children are still young and have not yet fully demonstrated their independent

will and ability, they should be able to obey their parents. However, as children grow up, their

independent  will  and  desire  for  control  become  more  robust,  and  parent-child  conflicts  are

inevitable  unless  their  independent  desires  or  individuality  are  suppressed.  The  operating

mechanism of filial piety is  the principle of reverencing the superior, and its connotation  or

norm is "suppress oneself and obey parents," thereby avoiding conflicts and forming "implicit

and virtual harmony." This differs from the "substantial harmony of affinity" in which everyone

shares the yang filial piety.

52

(2) Resource Giving and Receiving

Parents are the controllers and givers of life resources, and children are the requesters and

recipients. Usually, resource controllers have the right to speak, lead, and direct. Different from

the power derived from status, the source of this power is resources, but the results of the two

are similar. That is, the children of resource requesters will have a sense of humility and awe

for resource controllers, and the parents of resource controllers will have a feeling of humility

and awe for the children of resource requesters—a heart of respect and authority. Furthermore,

resources are necessary for survival and can meet various basic survival needs. Before children

are  financially  independent,  they  always  rely  on  their  parents,  so  the  resource  liabilities

accumulated from birth to financial independence are challenging to measure. Therefore, as the

requesters and recipients of resources for a long time, children's inner feelings of incompetence,

inferiority, and debt accumulate and become stronger, so their motivation to repay their parents

also strengthens. The operating mechanism of filial piety in resource giving and receiving is

"the principle of reverencing the superior and "the repay principle", and its connotation or norm

is "suppress oneself and obey parents" and "protect and honor parents".

"Bao" (repay) or "the norm of reciprocity" (the norm of reciprocity) is ubiquitous in human

society  (Homans,  1958)  and  is  one  of  the  basic  human  moral  norms  (Gouldner,  1960).  It

contains the principle of "fairness and justice", or the broader concept is the law of "dynamic

equilibrium". "Repay" is the most common form of repayment (positive reward) and revenge

(negative reward); that is, when others treat me well, I repay their kindness; when others do evil

to me, I repay their hatred (Wen, 1982), thereby satisfying fairness and justice and achieving

psychological  balance.  "Retribution"  has  different  connotations  and  expressions  in  various

contexts.  For  example,  with  the  other  categories  of  interpersonal  relationships  (such  as

emotional relationships, instrumental relationships, or mixed relationships), the methods and

duration  of  "retribution"  are  different  (Hwang,  2009).  "Retribution"  also  has  cultural

differences. Research has found that Chinese people's "retribution" belief may affect negative

returns through the intermediary variable of forgiveness or tolerance (Zhang & Zhang, 2012),

which is slightly different from Westerners (Perugini et al., 2003).

"Yang filial piety shared by the group" and "Yang filial piety in the authority position"

both have the repay principle, but the former is based on reciprocity and altruism. The emotional

basis is respect and love (our group's preference), and the form of repayment includes spiritual,

emotional, material, labor, and other aspects, covering the whole life; the latter is based on the

giving and receiving of resources, the emotional basis is awe (status), and the form of reward

53

is generally limited to the material and labor levels, which is less favored by Confucianism,

such as "The Analects of Confucius" chapter of "Wei Zheng" said: "Zi-You asked about filial

piety. Confucius said: "Today when people are said to be able to be filial to their parents, they

are said to be able to raise them. As for dogs and horses, they can also support their parents.

How can humans be different from dogs and horses if they do not respect their parents? "

3. Positive and Negative Effects Wax and Wane with Each Other

Since "Yang filial piety shared by the group" is rooted in the nature of self-love, it can

satisfy the basic needs of love, and reciprocity and altruism (mutual assistance and cooperation)

have the evolutionary advantage of achieving harmonious coexistence, thus producing positive

effects.  On the other hand, "Yang  filial piety in the authority position" is rooted in  people's

desire for power, control, and autonomy, as well as the fact that people must use life resources

to  meet  basic  survival  needs.  The  unequal  power  levels  and  resource  giving  and  receiving

between parents and children cause children to feel inferior, incompetent, and indebted, which

will have negative effects.

Yang filial piety shared by the group and Yang filial piety in the authority position interact

with each other. In childhood, the positive effect of Yang filial piety shared by the group is

often more significant  than the negative effect  of Yang filial piety in  the  authority position.

However, as children grow up, they gradually become less dependent on their parents, and the

number of in-groups gradually increases, diluting the parents' ego. The sense of belonging to

the  group  or  the  group  within  the  family,  so  the  positive  effects  of  in-group  favoritism  and

reciprocal altruism on the parents are weakened; at the same time, the children's independent

will and desire for control become stronger, and they have more and more conflicts with their

parents. Due to the virtual nature, Harmony turns into virtual or real conflict; coupled with the

increasing resource debt owed to parents, the inner feelings of incompetence, inferiority, and

debt  become  stronger;  therefore,  the  negative  effect  of  Yang's  filial  piety  in  the  authority

position gradually exceeds that of Yang filial piety. The positive impact of piety shared by the

group. This situation continued until the bereavement, and the two suddenly changed from yin

to  yang. Yang filial piety shared by the group changed from positive to  negative, and Yang

filial piety in the authority position changed from negative to positive.

V. Yin Filial Piety

54

1. Credentials of "Yin Filial Piety"

(1) As a Religious Person

Spirituality  makes  people  different  from  animals.  Religious  scholar  John  Hick  (1999)

believes  that  before  the  scientific  revolution  and  the  Age  of  Enlightenment,  human  beings

generally had religious beliefs. Archaeological evidence shows that religious behavior has been

widespread  among  humans  since  the  Paleolithic  period  (Armstrong,  2009).  Anthropologist

Robert  Marett  (1932)  therefore  argued  that  human  beings  should  be  called  religious  people

(Homo religiosus) rather than Homo sapiens (Homo sapiens). According to this, it seems human

instinct to believe that there is a transcendent realm outside the realm of phenomena (Bering,

2011). When encountering misfortune, suffering, illness, and psychological trauma, especially

when facing life and death, religious beliefs are often an essential reliance for the parties to

overcome these life hurdles (Tsai, 2007). Malinowski (1954) believed that religion originated

from people's attitudes and treatment of death and could solve questions such as where people

come from and where they are going, what the world is after death, and what the meaning of

life is. When children face bereavement and separation from their parents, it is natural for filial

children to develop religious psychology and behavior or seek help from religion (Walsh et al.,

2002).

(2) Modern People's Religious Beliefs and Beliefs About the Afterlife

According  to  Wikipedia,  more  than  80%  of  the  world's  people  hold  religious  beliefs

("Major Religions of the World," 2023), and nearly 15% of people have no religious beliefs

(including  atheists  and  agnostics)  ("Atheist  Population,"  2023).  According  to  data  from  the

World Christian Encyclopedia, from 1900 to 2000, the average proportion of religious believers

was between 80% and 85%, while those without religious beliefs accounted for between 15%

and 20% (Chiu, 2002). Academia Sinica, Taiwan, has conducted a five-year "Taiwan Social

Change Basic Survey Project" since 1985. The first survey results showed that nearly 90% of

the population has religious beliefs, and about 10% have no religious beliefs. The recent three

survey  reports  (respectively  in  2005,  2010,  and  2015)  show  that  about  80%  have  religious

beliefs and 20% have no religious beliefs (Fu et al., 2016). To sum up, overall, about 80% of

people have religious beliefs, and about 20% have no religious beliefs.

        Most religious believers believe in an afterlife, so belief in the afterlife is one of the

most important evidences of religious belief (Obayashi, 1992). The so-called "belief in afterlife"

refers to "the individual's belief in the authenticity of the situation that one will face after death"

55

(Tsai, 2007). Tsai and Ou (2008) found that most Taiwanese college students are dubious about

whether they believe in the afterlife. Therefore, regarding the afterlife, the concepts of "belief

in its existence" and "belief in its non-existence" coexist simultaneously. Thus, the later seven-

point Likert scale (the middle value of the scale is 4) is not measured with a single question (for

example,  from  firmly  believing  in  an  afterlife  to  not  thinking  at  all)  but  is  divided  into

"convinced that there will be an afterlife" and "convinced that there will be no afterlife." The

results of the two questions show that the former (M=4.47) is significantly greater than the latter

(M=3.72).

Tsai  and  Ou  (2008)  simultaneously  explored  college  students'  beliefs  about  "afterlife

situations" and "decision-making mechanisms." "The state of the afterlife" refers to the world,

field, or place after death, such as heaven (Nirvana), hell, another human world (Yellow Spring,

Youdu,  Mount  Tai),  transformation  from  ghost  to  god,  reincarnation,  etc.  "Decision

mechanism"  refers  to  the  mechanism  that  determines  how  the  situation  in  the  next  life  will

operate, such as karma, judgment (rewarding good and punishing evil through personal gods,

such as God, King Yama, etc.), redemption (justification by faith, eternal life by faith), natural

laws,  etc.  The  results  show  that  among  the  afterlife  situations,  reincarnation  (M=4.72)  is

significantly higher than others. In addition, regarding the decision mechanism, karma (M=4.50)

is considerably higher than others. It can be seen from this that college students believe most in

karma  and  reincarnation  (see  also  Tsai,  2018).  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  people  with  or

without religious beliefs tend to believe in an afterlife, as well as karma and reincarnation. One

study  used  an  Internet  survey  and  found  that  about  60%  of  people  tended  to  believe  in  the

"Buddhist doctrine of the cycle of cause and effect in past lives, present lives, and next lives"

(Yu, 2003). A survey by Chiu (2002, pp. 66-67) shows that 70% of the respondents believe that

there is a soul after death, and only 17% do not believe that; more than 60% of non-religious

people also believe in the existence of souls

        In summary, regardless of whether they have religious beliefs, most modern people believe

in the afterlife, souls, karma, and reincarnation. This theory of Yin filial piety is based on this,

specifically referring to karma.

(3) Filial Piety and Religion

"Filial  piety"  initially  contained  a  strong  religious  connotation.  The  "Dake  Ding"

inscription of the Western Zhou Dynasty says: "The emperor is wise and wise and beholds filial

piety at Shen." "Gou" means "show," and "Shen" means "god"; the inscription of "Zhong Shifu

Ding" says: "It is used to enjoy filial piety. The "Yusi Kou Hu" inscription says: "It is used to

56

enjoy filial piety, to pray for eyebrows and longevity, and to be used as a treasure by future

generations." The "Chen Niyan" inscription says: "It is used to enjoy filial piety and to be filial

to the great clan. Imperial ancestor and descendant." The inscriptions on these bronze vessels

record  "use  to  enjoy  filial  piety"  or  "use  to  enjoy  filial  piety,"  which  refers  to  worshiping

ancestors and gods (Han, 2017). It can be seen from this that the main interaction object of filial

piety  before  Confucius  was  the  transcendent  realm,  such  as  ancestors  or  gods,  as  shown  in

"Guoyu. "Zhou Yu Xia," says, "Speaking of filial piety must reach the gods." As for filial piety

in the ethical norm, it had to wait until after Confucius to reveal it fully, but "Yin filial piety"

was not wholly abandoned.

In  fact,  Confucius  attached  great  importance  to  filial  piety.  Zai-Wo  complained  to

Confucius  that  three  years  of  mourning  was  too  long,  but  Confucius  scolded  him  for  being

"mal- benevolence." It can also be seen from this that Confucius attaches great importance to

"benevolence", which is first implemented in specific filial piety; if filial piety can be practiced,

whether yang filial piety or yin filial piety, benevolence will be demonstrated. Confucius said,

"When the father is present, observe his ambitions; when the father is gone, observe his actions;

if you do not change your father's ways for three years, you can be called filial piety." ("The

Analects of Confucius: Xueer"), this is also a type of Yin filial piety. In addition, Confucius

defined the basic moral code of filial piety as "no violation", which means "to do things with

propriety, to bury people with propriety, and to offer sacrifices with propriety." Among them,

"to  bury  people  with  propriety,  and  to  offer  sacrifices  with  propriety"  is  Yin  filial  piety.  In

addition, Zeng-Shen was a famous filial son among the disciples of Confucius. The Analects of

Confucius records that Zeng Zi mentioned filial piety three times, twice about filial piety. They

were "Be careful to pursue the past, and the people's virtues will be thick" ("The Analects of

Confucius.") and "I have heard that all Master: If a person has not done anything for himself,

he must also be bereaved!" ("The Analects of Confucius. Zi Zhang") It can be seen that Zengzi

attaches great importance to filial piety.

        Documents and opinions about the religious nature of filial piety are quite scattered and

trivial.  During  the  Ming  Dynasty,  Chun-Xi  Yu  elaborated  on  Yin  filial  piety  more

systematically.  He  believes  filial  piety  is  an  ethical  and  moral  norm  with  a  transcendent

dimension. It existed before the creation of the universe.  It is the source of all things in the

universe and the natural and humanistic order. It is also the norm that maintains the harmony

of  the  world  (Lu,  2011,  see  Chapter  4).  Yu's  important  work,  "Collection  of  Filial  Piety

Classics," is mainly based on "The Book of Filial Piety: Chapter of Induction of Filial Piety. "

The ultimate in  filial  piety and brotherhood, it reaches the  gods, shines in the world,  and is

57

omnipotent."  It  collects  stories and sayings about "The Classic of Filial Piety" from various

texts of the past dynasties, involving many supernatural powers and deeds of filial piety and

divine response; there are many examples of Yin filial piety worth referring to. Yu believes that

everyone has gods in their hearts, that is, innate conscience, and "communicating with gods"

means that the gods in people's hearts interact with the gods who dominate the universe. This

must be guided by "Gongfu theory." He then put forward the practice of fasting in "The Method

of Full Filial Piety": "It can be seen that this body is not only the body of the parents, but also

the body of heaven and earth, and the body of "Taixu". The way to maintain the body is just to

control the "chi" and capture the spirit; to control the "chi" and capture the spirit is for love and

respect. To love and respect the most, to fast and cleanse the heart until the awe-inspiring aura

fills the space between heaven and earth, and the bright light shines in all directions. Only then

can  we  be  fully  filial,  and  only  then  can  we  be  called  filial  son."  According  to  this,  "love,

respect" is the foundation of filial piety.

2. Yan Filial Piety to Yin Filial Piety

Filial  piety  changes  yin  and  yang  due  to  bereavement.  Although  the  universal

transcendental  categories  of  Yan  and  Yin  filial  piety  remain  unchanged,  the  specific

connotations have only changed slightly (Yan filial piety does not commemorate parents, and

Yin filial piety does not support parents). Still, the emotional basis, motivation source, operating

mechanism, and effect expression have changed drastically.

        The emotional basis of Yin filial piety is "regret." "Regret" in English is "regret", which

comes from the Old French regres, and its original meaning is sadness or disappointment. In

the fifteenth century, the word first entered English to describe the grief of losing a relative,

friend, or status. At the time, regret was a form of performance, "regrettes" (regrettes) used to

accentuate expressions of grief, such as mourning at wakes and crying at funerals. In the 16th

century, regret was gradually combined with the concept of self-internalization and then began

to form a modern semantic meaning with self-blame. However, to this day, regret still maintains

its earlier connection with "loss" (the loss of relatives and friends) (Smith, 2015/2016, pp. 367-

368).

Yin filial piety, "regret," such as Yan filial piety, "respect," also adopts a similar concept

of family resemblance. The emotional effect cannot be judged from a single emotion; it depends

on what it is combined with. "Regret" contains elements such as regret, remorse, remorse, and

repentance.  "Regret"  originally  refers  to  the  emotion  a  person  has  because  he  didn't  do

58

something he should have done or did something he shouldn't have done. If you feel sorry for

yourself, blame yourself, live in the past, and don't know how to change, "regret" is combined

with sadness to become "regret", or combined with guilt to become "regret", the effect will be

negative. If your mood changes, you can make up for what you should have done but not do in

the future, and you can do something else to make up for it in the future. It will have a positive

effect. No one is a saint, and no one can make mistakes. The key is to repent, "Book of Changes:

Fu Gua"(Returning Hexagram): "Recover not far away, no regrets, only good luck," so "regret"

is not only negative but also positive. Zhu Xi expressed it most accurately: "Repent of one's

own  misfortune  and  seek  good  fortune."  Therefore,  "regret"  combined  with  enlightenment

becomes  "repentance",  and  combined  with  correction  becomes  "repentance",  which  has  a

positive effect.

        Generally speaking,  regret  and remorse cause people to  lose their life motivation,  while

repentance and regret  stimulate it. Yin filial piety is  based on the contradictory emotions  of

regret and remorse, remorse and remorse, and the urge to die and live (Table 2).

3. Yin Filial Piety Shared by the Group

Yin filial piety shared by the group means "respect & be kind to parents" and "In memory

of parents." The former is lifelong filial piety, which can be generally used as Yin filial piety.

The latter includes support (Yang filial piety) and sacrifice (Yin filial piety). Since support is

not suitable for sharing Yin filial piety, it is abandoned. The connotations of Yin filial piety

shared by the group are "respect & be kind to parents" and "In memory of parents." Its emotional

basis is regret and remorse. The power source of regret is loss, and the operating principle is
59

the  principle  of  favoring  the  intimate;  the  power  source  of  regret  is  guilt,  and  the  operating

principle is the karma principle.

(1) Loss

Parents are flesh and blood, the closest people in the world. When parents pass away, flesh

and blood  are separated, heaven and  earth  are separated forever,  and the  sense of loss is  so

strong that it is self-evident. This sense of loss brings sadness and grief, which is human nature;

but Chinese people's filial piety is strengthened for three reasons. First of all, Chinese parents

are  a part of themselves (Zhu  et  al.,  2007). When a parent passes  away,  it is  as if  a part of

themselves  has  also  passed  away,  and  the  sense  of  loss  is  deeper  and  heavier.  Secondly,

compared with  social cultures that follow traditional  family values  and role norms, children

with filial piety have a higher mortality rate, which should be related to a sense of loss (Saarela

& Rostilla, 2018); Chinese culture is family-oriented (Yang & Yeh, 2005), so it will Intensify

feelings of loss. Finally, Chinese culture requires certain norms to be followed during mourning

or  filial  piety  customs.  Among  them,  it  is  most  important  for  children  to  express  grief  and

mourning. There are even funeral ceremonies called "Five Sons Crying at the Grave" or "Filial

Daughter  Baiqin".  The  sadder  and  more  miserable  you  cry,  the  more  filial  piety  you  show,

which will intensify the grief of your children. The above three points may also become the

specific connotation of Yin filial piety shared by the group, collectively known as "Sorrow to

express filial piety".

The operating mechanism of lost filial piety is "the principle of favoring the intimate. Only

when there is love will there be sadness and loss; the closer we are, the more loved we are, the

greater the sense of loss and the sadder we will be."

Bereavement is  often detrimental  to  children's physical  and mental  health and adaptive

development.  There  are  many  regulating  or  mediating  variables,  such  as  parents  dying  of

expected  natural  death  (such  as  chronic  disease,  aging  failure)  or  unnatural  death  (such  as

accidents,  suicide),  gender  differences  (  Father  vs.  son,  father  vs.  daughter,  mother  vs.  son,

mother vs. daughter), age (deceased parents, age of children at that time), family upbringing,

socioeconomic  status,  education  level,  family  disease  history,  parent-child  relationship,

parental personality, caregivers' adaptation status after children's bereavement, etc. (Berg et al.,

2016;  Dowdney,  2000).  More  importantly,  it  is  essential  to  look  at  the  children's  coping

strategies for bereavement, which are within their control; they generally include avoidance,

rumination, positive coping, seeking support, stress assessment, controlling beliefs, maintaining

self-esteem, etc. (Lazarus & Folkman, 1991; Schmiege et al., 2006).

60

This theory cuts through the moral and religious aspects and believes that there is a strategy

or mechanism that can be transformed so that children can not only overcome the difficulties

in life, such as bereavement, but also improve the realm of life, make people outstanding, and

also  make people connect  with  each other,  and  people with  each other.  Harmony of natural

relationships.  The  mechanism  is  "compensation",  and  "compensation"  is  closely  related  to

"guilt", another source of motivation shared by the group

  (2) Remorse, Shame or Guilt

Although  most  people  will  feel  lost  and  sad  when  essential  people  such  as  relatives

(parents, siblings, relatives), partners, close friends, etc. pass away, the death of a parent is also

accompanied by feelings of debt, guilt, regret, and even guilt. Parents are unparalleled in their

kindness to their children, so it is only natural for children to be grateful to their parents and

feel deeply indebted to them and want to repay them. It is difficult for parents to repay their

kindness while they are still alive, and since they cannot repay their kindness after their death,

regret,  regret,  or  guilt  will  inevitably  arise  in  their  hearts.  Confucian  culture  has  always

emphasized  repaying  kindness,  especially  the  kindness  of  parents  (Wang,  1994),  and  may

attribute part of the death of parents to failure to fulfill their duties as children. At the same time,

both Confucianism and Buddhism place great emphasis on repaying kindness, especially the

kindness of parents (Wang, 1994), which may further strengthen the Children's feelings of guilt

and guilt. This can also become the specific connotation of Yin filial piety shared by the group,

which is "responsible for oneself and showing filial piety."

The operating mechanism of apologetic filial piety is the law of "karma". "Karma" has

five  major  characteristics.  (1)  Morality;  (2)  Causality;  (3)  Principles  of  fairness  and  justice;

these  three  characteristics  are  roughly  similar  to  "retribution",  but  there  are  differences  in

causality. "Karma" is self-inflicted. You make your own karma and bear it yourself. Both the

cause and the bearer of the consequences are the moral subjects themselves; or the bearers are

family  members  or  families.  This  is  an  inherent  idea  of  Chinese  traditional  culture  and  is  a

family orientation; or it is through "Return" to others. "Retribution" is not the case. Both the

cause and the bearer of the result are others, and he is an intermediary or reactionary role, with

the reverse ability of repay, requite or retaliate.

As for the other two characteristics of "karma," (4) appeal to the transcendent realm and

(5) the  assumption of the next  life, they are the  most critical  differences  from  "retribution."

"Retribution" has neither of these two points. The scope of application of the law of retribution

is the human world, and the objects of interaction are actual living people. The interaction object

61

of filial piety is the parents. Once the parents pass away, the law of retribution becomes invalid.

However, the three principles of "retribution" - morality, causality, fairness, and justice - do not

disappear.  Therefore,  "karma,"  which  contains  these  three  principles  but  still  appeals  to  the

presupposition  of  transcendence  and  the  next  life,  must  be  cited  as  the  yin—the  operating

principle  of  filial  piety.  Research  shows  that  "karma"  beliefs  are  indeed  related  to  the  five

characteristics mentioned above, and the results are similar for samples from various cultural

and  religious  backgrounds  (India,  the  United  States,  and  Canada)  (White  et  al.,  2019).  The

operating mechanism of "karma" is "karma," which is a transcendent force that can promote

karma and retribution and solve the moral philosophical problem of "the consistency of virtue

and  fortune."  It  is  assumed  that  the  personal  God  Yama,  ghosts,  or  God  will  make  moral

judgments,  which  belong  to  folk  beliefs,  Taoism,  Christianity,  or  other  religions.  Many

believers are second only to karma (Tsai & Ou, 2008). If the karma principle is broadly defined

here, it also includes this decision-making mechanism.

        Both  impersonal  karma  and  retribution,  as  well  as  personal  gods'  rewards  for  good  and

punishment for evil, are important mechanisms for maintaining the social order of China in the

past, and are also important factors in the implementation of filial piety. Through the circulation

of various good books and weft books in the society, and through the promotion of families,

folk religious groups and the official court, we continue to convey that "filial piety can inspire

gods  and  summon  auspiciousness",  "the  most  filial  piety  can  inspire  heaven  and  summon

blessings", "Unfilial piety will lead to evil retribution" and "evil children will go to hell", these

beliefs are deeply rooted in people's hearts (Lu, 2011). Therefore, the role of the karma principle

in filial piety must not be underestimated.

4. Yin Filial Piety in the Authority Position

The a priori norms for Yin filial piety in the authority position are "suppress oneself and

obey parents" and "protect and honor parents," which means lifelong filial piety. Therefore, it

can be generally used as Yin filial piety in the authority position. Its emotional basis is remorse

and regret, its motivation source is liberation and compensation, and its operating mechanism

is the principle of Tao and the karma principle.

(1) Liberation

Parent-child  interaction  conflicts  originate  from  unequal  power  levels  and  resource

allocations  and  are  manifested  in  inconsistencies  in  values  (different  life  goals  and  career

62

choices, parental demands that violate morals or ethics), role dilemmas (children's roles and

obligations  conflict  with  other  roles,  or  When  parents  quarrel,  children  are  in  the  middle.

Whichever side they take will make the other party unhappy and they are in a dilemma), and

parents demand more than their children are capable of. Among them, "inconsistent values" are

the most common, accounting for 98% in terms of people and events. Accounting for 60% (Yeh,

2008), it is the most critical, the most frequent, the most persistent, and the most difficult to

deal  with.  However,  after  the  death  of  parents,  these  conflicts  no  longer  exist,  and  many

pressures of "suppress oneself and obey parents" are suddenly relieved, especially when parents

may have oppressed their children's values, will, or actions and even restricted their children's

life path, at this time, children can fully demonstrate their independent will and follow their

own path  in  life. According to  this, the operating mechanism of liberating  filial  piety  is  the

principle of Tao.

The  word  "道"  is  composed  of  "walk"(辶,  走)  and  "first"(首).  The  first  word  "道"  in

"道道" is a verb, from "walk," which means to walk, act, and practice; the second word "道" is

a noun, from first, which means first to practice the path of life. The path of life is divided into

a "little path" and a "big path." The former refers to the achievement motivation that satisfies

the personal ego, while the latter refers to the compassionate motivation that satisfies altruism

and  great  love.  For  example,  "Book  of  Rites:  Li  Yun"  says:  "The  journey  of  the  great  road

means that the world is for the common good." All mortals have two components: the ego (self-

interest) and the ego (altruism) (Li, 2019). Only the ego is more dominant and often wants to

maintain, show, and achieve oneself. If you're going to follow the "high road," you must always

moderately  suppress  or  sacrifice  the  ego.  This  is  the  meaning  of  Yin  filial  piety:  "suppress

oneself and obey parents" (also including "protect and honor parents"). In this regard, the reason

why Yang filial piety and Yin filial piety "suppress oneself" is to follow group norms and pursue

group harmony. However, the "groups" they refer to are different. In Yang filial piety, the group

is limited to the parent group or family, and the norms come from this. The ego is suppressed

or sacrificed to achieve family harmony and continue the family lifeline. In Yin filial piety, the

group has transcended our group and expanded to other groups. The norms come from society

or all humanity, and we pursue the harmonious coexistence and endless prosperity of society,

all humanity, and even all things in the universe. How does this connect to filial piety? The

mechanism is "compensation," which will be explained later.

In  addition  to  the  stress  of  parent-child  conflict,  other  stressors  are  relieved  with

bereavement.  As  children  grow  up,  become  financially  independent,  and  possess  more  and

more resources, on the other hand, as their parents grow older, sicker, and face retirement or

63

even death,  the roles of  both  parties in  resource  giving and receiving  are reversed,  with  the

children giving resources in return and the parents receiving resources. Unlike the parents of

Yin filial piety minor children, who often die unnaturally, the parents of Yin filial piety adult

children usually die naturally. They may suffer from chronic diseases, have limited mobility,

or are bedridden and in great need of their children's care. This situation may cause significant

harm to their children. Mental stress (worry about the death of parents, seeing parents in pain,

taking up a lot of time, pressure to pay for medical care or insurance, etc.). If you don't take

good care of your parents, you may get the reputation of "a chronically ill and unfilial son."

Once parents pass away, many of these pressures are released (Umberson & Chen, 1994), and

inheritance  can  be  inherited,  which  is  undoubtedly  a  positive  effect  on  children  (Rostila  &

Saarela, 2011). However, these positive effects are short-term and gradually weaken over time,

even being submerged in the negative effects of loss and guilt of Yin filial piety shared by the

group. For example, Rostila and Saarela (2011) stated: "Time does not consequently heal all

wounds, as long-term grief and regret at the loss of the parent might outweigh the short-term

relief from burdens and worries." Unfortunately, they did not delve into the underlying cause,

nor did they propose a solution.

(2) Compensation

The positive effect of "liberation" is not only short-lived but also limited to the individual

(ego). If you want to continue the positive effect and extend it to others (the greater self), you

must  use  "compensation"  to  achieve  it.  "Compensation"  is  a  coping  strategy  or  defense

mechanism.  The  most  significant  difference  from  other  methods  and  mechanisms  is  that  its

operating principle comes from karma (retribution) and contains morality, causality, fairness,

justice, and religion.

On  the  surface,  conflicts,  stress,  and  negative  effects  between  parents  and  children

disappear with the loss of a parent, but in fact, this is not the case; a passing goose will leave

its mark, and it will still affect the children's body and mind to some extent. At the same time,

children are grateful and owe their parents nothing in return, and their feelings of guilt and guilt

are  difficult  to  resolve.  This  sense  of  moral  guilt  must  be  determined  by  virtue  or  religious

power. It is necessary to repent and repent in order to "turn one's evil into a good fortune." The

compensation function can be used to make up for the unfilial disobedience to parents due to

conflicts or other situations and the debt to parents for their upbringing. Since actual interaction

with  parents  is  no  longer  possible,  its  compensatory  effect  turns  to  two  different  aspects:

interaction with oneself and interaction with other people and even everything.

64

Interacting with oneself means cherishing one's own life more while passing on the family

lineage,  practicing  kindness,  protecting  and  continuing  the  lifeline  of  one's  parents,  gaining

success and fame through the principle of Tao, and honoring one's parents. This belongs to the

"protect  and  honor  parents"  of  the  "small  path"  (ego).  The  introduction  mentioned  that  the

proportion of successful people who lost their parents in early life was more significant than

expected (Eisenstadt, 1978), and the proportion of people with IQs above 155 who lost their

parents  in  early  life  was  three  times  the  expected  value  (Albert,  1971).  This  theory  can

reasonably explain it. First, Yang filial piety, "suppress oneself and obey parents," has negative

effects  on  individual  personality  and  cognitive  development,  such  as  depression,  obedience,

conservatism,  lack  of  flexibility,  self-expression,  creativity,  cognitive  complexity,  etc.,

bereavement. Then, it weakens or disappears or even rebounds, and the children are "liberated"

wholeheartedly. Secondly, to make up for the inner guilt or guilt towards the parents, the Taoist

Law can be used to induce motivation to invest in work or creative activities.

        Interactions with other people and even all things are divided into relatives, acquaintances,

strangers,  and  all  things  in  the  universe  according  to  their  closeness  and  distance.  Research

shows that bereavement affects children's interaction with relatives (Fuller-Thomson, 2000).

However, there is almost no research on acquaintances and strangers, let alone all things in the

universe.  Furthermore,  although  a  few  studies  mention  the  compensatory  role,  they  refer  to

filling the gap after the loss of parental emotional support, such as a sense of family, family

stability,  personal  affirmation,  etc.  (Umberson,  2003),  and  do  not  involve  the  moral  and

religious aspects. This is entirely different from the meaning of "compensation" in this theory.

        The  interactive  objects  of  compensation  can  be  expanded  from  our  group  (including

relatives) to other groups and even all things in the world. The former is like "Mencius: The

King of Liang Hui" said: "I am old and I am the old of others, and I am the young and the young

of others." The compensation behavior refers to "doing good and eliminating evil," that is, doing

all the good and refraining from doing evil from repaying the parents. The Buddhist vocabulary

is  "dedicated."  The  latter  regards  heaven  and  earth  as  their  parents,  with  heaven  (Qian)

symbolizing father and earth (Kun) symbolizing mother. Or parents' life originates from heaven

and  earth.  Therefore,  they  can  also  practice  filial  piety,  that  is,  love  and  care,  by  nurturing

heaven and earth and all things in the universe (referred to as "nurturing all things"). Protecting

the earth and protecting the ecology is the most thorough, ultimate, complete, and highest-level

practice of filial piety. For this reason, practicing all good deeds, refraining from doing evil,

caring for the earth, and maintaining the ecology are new elements of Yin filial piety in the

authority position, which are specific to the Great Way (big self) "suppress oneself and obey

65

parents" and "protect and honor parents" The connotation and ultimate goal is the "harmonious

coexistence" and "endless life" of all things in the universe.

5. Positive and Negative Effects Wax and Wane with Each Other

The  operating  mechanism  of  "Yin  filial  piety  shared  by  the  group"  is  the  principle  of

favoring the intimate and the karma principle—the principle of favoring the intimate from Yang

filial piety to Yin filial piety. Loss leads to sorrow and regret, and even sorrow is used to express

filial piety. The karma principle leads to guilt and regret, and one may even blame oneself for

showing filial piety. Here, "karma" refers to the past causes that create the present results, which

is more likely to lead to fatalistic negative thoughts. According to the above, Yin filial piety

shared by the group has a negative effect.

The operating mechanism of "Yin filial piety in the authority position" is the principle of

Tao and the karma principle. The principle of Tao: Since parent-child conflict no longer exists,

and other stressors related to filial piety disappear with the loss, the children's bodies and minds

are "liberated," they can fully demonstrate their independent will and move towards the small

path and the great road. As for the karma principle, it uses repentance and repentance to urge

the  operation  of  "compensation"  psychology  and  practice  the  minor  and  significant  ways;

especially the major sutras eliminate evil and cultivate all things for good, reaching the highest

state  of  filial  piety  practice.  "Karma"  here  refers  to  the  current  cause  that  creates  future

consequences. This idea and belief that current actions determine the future positively affect

creating destiny. To sum up, Yin filial piety in the authority position has a positive effect.

The positive and negative effects of Yin filial piety in the authority position and Yin filial

piety shared by the group are mutually reinforcing. The parents have just passed away, and the

loss and guilt of Yin filial piety shared by the group immediately take effect. Regret and remorse

are  the  dominant  emotions.  Repentance  and  repentance  have  not  yet  emerged.  The

"compensation" function of Yin filial piety in the authority position has not yet taken effect.

Although "Liberation" has a positive effect, the duration is short; therefore, overall, the negative

effect of Yin filial piety shared by the group is greater than the positive effect of Yin filial piety

shared in the authority position. Time is a healing medicine. The children's sense of loss and

grief will gradually fade away. However, the parents' debt of kindness will still be there, so the

guilt and regret will not disappear unless the children can repent, repent, start "compensation,"

and practice the small way and the big way to repay their parents in this way, liabilities will

gradually be offset, and balance will eventually be reached. Accordingly, the negative effect of

66

Yin filial piety shared by the group gradually weakens. In contrast, the positive effect of Yin

filial piety in the authority position gradually strengthens and exceeds the former and finally

reaches a state where all things in the universe coexist harmoniously and continue to thrive.

VI. Comprehensive Discussion

1. Universal and Diverse Filial Piety

The  study  of  "filial  piety"  differs  from  "parent-child  relationship."  The  latter  does  not

presuppose cultural factors, while filial piety does. It must be in history, culture, and Chinese

context  to  demonstrate  its  profound  significance.  Furthermore,  the  study  of  parent-child

relationships  does  not  presuppose  a  transcendent  boundary.  It  only  involves  the  interaction

between parents and children in the human world, so it is limited to Yang filial piety. If we look

at the cultural system, filial piety undoubtedly contains Yin filial piety. Although filial piety is

an essential value in Chinese culture, it has elements of a universal emotional foundation and

operating mechanism. In fact, "Yin Yang Theory of Filial Piety" reveals the connotation and

mechanism of filial piety from a deep analysis of universal human nature. However, the key

lies in constructing a theory of filial piety consistent with "one mind, multiple mentalities." This

is a big problem.

Indigenous  psychologists  emphasize  multiple  mentalities,  highlighting  the  differences

between Eastern and Western cultures. For example, Hwang (2009) believes that filial piety is

a characteristic of Chinese culture and cannot be explained by Western ethics. Hwang relied on

Kantian  ethics  and  Gert  (1973)  to  clarify  that  "negative  duty"  requires  people  not  to  do

something (such as not to kill, steal, or lie), and it should be observed regardless of time, space,

or situation. It is mandatory. Therefore, it is a "perfect duty"; if it is violated, it is a vice.

In contrast, "positive duty" requires people to do something (such as performing good deeds).

It is a maxim that guides actions. It does not indicate specific actions, does not define the scope

of use, and allows exceptions. It does not have It is mandatory, so it is an "imperfect duty"; if

it is not practiced, it is only a lack of virtue and is not a sin. However, this cannot be applied to

filial piety because Confucian culture stipulates that children must "fulfill filial piety," which is

a  positive  obligation,  but  it  is  mandatory,  so  it  is  a  complete  obligation,  not  an  incomplete

obligation; "unfilial piety" is an unforgivable sin, not just a lack of virtue. Accordingly, filial

piety is an "unconditioned positive duty." However, the same may be true for Westerners.

67

Western culture has a vital religious  component and is a monotheistic religion. 80% of

Westerners hold religious beliefs (Chiu, 2002). All believers must abide by precepts, such as

the Ten Commandments. The first four commandments are for interaction between humans and

the transcendent realm; the last six are norms for interpersonal interaction. Five of them (killing,

adultery,  stealing,  lying,  and  greed)  are  both  negative  obligations  and  complete  obligations,

which  are  mandatory.  The  only  exception  to  the  commandment  is  the  positive  obligation

commandment:  "Honor  your  parents."  According  to  the  unified  nature  of  the  Ten

Commandments, it should also be a complete obligation and mandatory. If it is violated, it is a

sin. It is not just a lack of virtue, just like "filial piety."  Based on this, Hwang's statement is

worthy of question. On the contrary, "filial piety" should have a universal component (here, it

refers  specifically  to  its  actual  universality);  more  precisely,  "filial  piety"  is  a  unique  moral

norm, which is different from other positive obligations, and although it is unique, it is universal.

Cross-cultural research shows that both Eastern and Western cultures have three components

of filial piety: respect and obedience, pleasing parents, and financial support (Ng et al., 2000).

The latter two belong to the respect & be kind to parents and serve parents of filial piety shared

by the group. In contrast, the obedience of the former belongs to suppress oneself and obey

parents of Yang filial piety in the authority position. As for respect, respect, which is combined

with "love" or "fear," tends to be shared by the group (reverence and love) or in the authority

position (reverence).

The  dual  universality  approach  points  out  that  practical  universality  can  be  achieved

through cross-cultural, development, and temporal research. Cross-cultural research does not

consider  time,  which  has  shortcomings  that  must  be  made  up  for  by  developmental  and

temporal research. For example, Yeh (1997) studied the changing status of various filial piety

items over time and found that for some items, such as obedience, carrying on the family line,

inheriting  family  property,  and  being  at  one's  side,  people's  attention  or  recognition  has

gradually  declined.  People  attend  funerals,  pay  homage  to  their  parents,  and  support  their

parents. Making relatives worry-free and treating relatives courteously are still highly valued

and  recognized.  Components  that  do  not  change  in  time  and  space  are  more  likely  to  be

universal. The components that change over time and space may have less universality, and

three  types  of  cultural  differences  exist.  First  of  all,  every  culture  has  it,  but  the  degree  of

emphasis  or  recognition  is  different.  This  is  a  quantitative  change.  Secondly,  it  exists  in  all

cultures, but the specific behaviors are different; that is, it is diversified. For example, attending

funerals  and  paying  homage  varies  with  each  religious  belief.  These  two,  "one  mind,  many

states of mind," are still within the scope of universality. The last type has been qualitatively

68

changed and has no universal elements; that is, it is present in some cultures and not in others,

such as burial sacrifice and infanticide. Based on this criterion, the "changing concept of filial

piety"  does  not  necessarily  have  to  be  universal.  It  depends  on  whether  it  is  a  quantitative

change, a diversified presentation, or a qualitative change.

2. The Mystery of Positive and Negative Effects

This theory is based on the pragmatist stance and uses functions and effects to speculate

on the nature of reality. Research shows that filial piety has both positive and negative effects,

and factor analysis has found two major factors, so it is reasonable to speculate that there are

two operating components. Based on this, two universal people are used: "shared by the group"

and  "in  the  authority  position."  The  prototype  of  interpersonal  interaction  serves  as  the  two

transcendental categories of filial piety. According to the evolutionary perspective, "Yang filial

piety shared by the group" has adaptive advantages for individual psychological needs (love)

and group levels (family cohesion or harmony), has a positive effect, and is naturally preserved

by natural selection; on the other hand, "Yang filial piety" "in the authority position" is less

conducive  to  individual  adaptation  and  development  and  has  a  negative  effect.  Why  is  it

retained? Presumably, positive effects,  such  as disease  genes,  will also  bring some benefits.

Several possibilities are explained below.

        (1) Parents are resource givers; children can obtain resources by supporting themselves and

obeying  their  parents.  In  other  words,  "Yang  filial  piety  of  authority  ranking"  helps  parents

continue to operate and provide resources to meet their children's basic survival needs. This is

at the level of individual needs.

        (2)  Children  can  learn  social  norms  and  rules  of  interpersonal  interaction  (such  as  the

principle  of  reverencing  the  superior  or  various  strategies  to  obtain  resources,  etc.)  through

parents granting resources and instructing power. This is the key to crossing from the individual

to the group level.

        (3) At the group level, if the above two points are valid, they can promote the harmonious

coexistence of families, although there are primarily virtual harmonious elements.

        (4) From the perspective of dynamic development, "Yang filial piety of authority ranking"

will show positive effects when it turns into Yin filial piety after bereavement.

"Yin filial  piety  shared  by the  group"  also  has  a negative  effect; why is  it retained?  In

essence, Yin filial piety depends on Yin filial piety; Yang filial piety is the master, Yin filial

piety is the slave, and the various characteristics of Yin filial piety are roughly derived from

69

Yang filial piety. Everyone experiences Yang  filial  piety, but  relatively  few  experience Yin

filial  piety;  many  people  pass  away  without  Yin  filial  piety.  Furthermore,  Yang  filial  piety

begins  to  operate  at  the  moment  of  birth,  and  the  development  trajectory  is  relatively

straightforward. However, the starting point of Yin filial piety is highly variable and may occur

from childhood, adolescence, adulthood, middle age, or even after parents' death in old age.

Therefore,  Yang  filial  piety  is  more  necessary,  routine  and  regular.  According  to  this,

evolutionary selection mainly occurs in Yang filial piety, not Yin filial piety. Since "Yang filial

piety shared by the group" is retained due to its obvious adaptive advantages, "Yin filial piety

shared by the group" is also maintained, even if the effect is negative. Moreover, the loss, grief,

guilt, and regret of "Yin filial piety shared by the group" are not entirely negative. They and

"Yin filial piety in the authority position" have a yin and yang relationship with each other; the

latter's positive effects or adaptive advantages are based on in the former, for example, the sense

of guilt is the source of motivation to repay parents, and the feeling of guilt is the source of

motivation for children to atone for their sins.

In short, although "Yang filial piety in the authority position" has a negative effect, there

are still many positive effects. From the perspective of "Yang filial piety shared by the group,"

"Yang  filial  piety  in  the  authority  position"  is  indispensable.  Imagine  the  transformation

between positive and negative after the loss of a parent. If there is only the negative effect of

"Yin filial  piety shared by the group" and no other mechanism to  counteract  and transform.

How should the children overcome this difficulty in life? Fortunately, the negative effect can

be turned back into a positive effect through "Yin filial piety in the authority position."

In the same way, although "Yin filial piety shared by the group" has a negative effect, it depends

on "Yin filial piety shared by the group." It serves as the driving force for the positive effect of

"Yin filial piety in the authority position." The source has the advantage of adaptability and the

necessity of existence.

3. Midlife Crisis and Filial Piety

This  theory  uses  the  theory  of  Yin  and  Yang  as  the  metaphysical  presupposition  and

thinking framework. It divides filial piety into Yang filial piety and Yin filial piety based on

critical bereavement events. Most people experience bereavement only in adulthood, with the

majority of people experiencing bereavement in middle age (40 to 55 years old). Middle age is

quite special. Jung (1971) attached great importance to this period, believing there was the most

growth, the integrativeness of undeveloped personalities, and various other aspects that have

70

yet to be developed especially spirituality. Erikson (1963) believed that the conflict crisis in

this period was "generativity vs. stagnation." The crisis can be solved if it can be passed down

and taken care of for the next generation, or it can engage in creative activities and promote

cultural  development.  Failure  to  do  so  will  result  in  stagnation  and  self-absorption.  This  is

consistent with the connotation of this theory "Yin filial piety in the authority position", that is,

the experience of bereavement will promote the development of middle age, producing double

positive and negative effects, pulling each other together.

Middle-aged people are at the moment of transition between yin and yang, which refers to

the process of life and filial piety. If the average age of a person is 80 years old, then 40 years

old is in the middle. At this time, it is the summer solstice, when Yang Qi is at its peak and then

declines, and Yin Qi gradually grows, which is the critical point of the growth and decline of

Yin and Yang in life. In middle age, people often begin to face death, value spirituality, and

care for all living beings. As for filial piety, if Yang filial piety turns to Yin filial piety due to

bereavement in middle age, it will open up opportunities for "liberation" and "repair". Midlife

contains contradictions, conflicts, turmoil, chaos, and confusion (Jaques, 1965).

On the one hand, youth is gone, and the illusion of immortality and eternal youth finally

awakens and sighs; on the other hand, death is approaching, and one is helpless and anxious

about mortality and the uncertainty of life and death (Becker, 1973). Thus, Middle-aged people

face contradictory feelings of push and pull between creativity and stagnation, secularity and

religion, past and future, youth and aging, life and death. The cruel fact that parents eventually

died of old age and illness impacted their children's hearts and intensified such feelings (Gould,

1978).

In short, the effect of bereavement in mid-life is dual. It is both a crisis and an opportunity.

Children can use this to  explore the deeper meaning of life  (Douglas, 1991;  Gerson, 2018),

especially at the moral and religious level, and rethink themselves, others, and the natural world.,

interactive  relationships  beyond  boundaries.  This  theory  believes  that  the  most  critical

psychological mechanism is because parents' kindness is so great and overwhelming that it is

difficult to repay it throughout their lives. This is a significant shortcoming. It cannot satisfy

the fairness and justice law of "retribution," so it is in a state of severe imbalance and asymmetry,

resulting in " The role of "compensation" is to make up for it through creation, inheritance (the

way of kindness), good deeds, and great love, leading to the small way (leaving a legacy for

relatives, showing off relatives' names) and the significant way (doing good, eliminating evil,

and cultivating all things), to achieve balance, The ideal state of completeness and perfection.

71

4. Characteristics, Contributions, and Limitations of "Yin Yang Filial Piety Theory"

The  methodological  feature  of  this  theory  is  to  adopt  a  "double  universal  approach"  to

satisfy the principle of "one mind, many mentalities." In ontology, Yin and Yang are used as

the  transcendental  formal  structure,  which  can  combine  the  two  universal  interpersonal

interaction archetypes "shared by the group" and "in the authority position" and correspond to

"The  Dual  Filial  Piety  Model"  mutual  filial  piety,  and  authoritative  filial  piety.  This  theory

generally  meets  various  theoretical  specifications  in  the  theory  of  knowledge,  and  only  the

completeness and integrativeness are explained here.

In terms of completeness, this theory extends filial piety to life, including Yin filial piety,

and  proposes  four  new  connotations  of  filial  piety:  sadness  to  express  filial  piety,  self-

responsibility  to  show  filial  piety,  doing  good  and  eliminating  evil,  and  transforming  and

nurturing all things. It also contains favoring the intimate, reverencing the four laws of superior,

repay, and karma correspond to the four influencing factors of emotion, authority, exchange,

and religion on the changes in the concept of filial piety (Yeh, 1997). "The Dual Filial Piety

Model" and all other filial piety studies do not consider filial piety after bereavement and lack

the operating mechanism of religious factors. This theory proposes the concept of "Yin filial

piety" and the law of "karma," which is a significant feature and contribution. In addition to the

four laws of favoring the intimate, reverencing the superior, repaying, and karma, this theory

also proposes the law of "the principle of Tao." Although "Tao Dao" is a self-made word, its

conceptual connotation exists in the Chinese culture of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism.

It has the basis of universal human nature (such as self-interest and altruism). Confucianism

has two important operating principles: "favoring the intimate" and "reverencing the superior"

(Huang, 2009). "The Dual Filial Piety Model" was the first to cite these two terms and concepts

in  the  study  of  filial  piety  (Yeh,  2003,  2005).  However,  other  essential  concepts  in

Confucianism, such as "respecting oneself and others," "the world is for the common good,"

"university  in  the  world,"  and  "harmony  between  man  and  nature,"  have  been  ignored  by

researchers  on  filial  piety.  This  concept  is  consistent  with  Buddhism  and  Taoism.  It  can  be

unified into the idea of "the unity of heaven and man," which is the foundation of the unity of

the  three  religions  (Li,  2020).  Given  this,  this  article  proposes  the  "principle  of  Tao"  that

contains the unity of nature and man, including the "little way" and the "big way." The former

is  self-interested  and  achieves  oneself,  while  the  latter  is  generous,  nurturing  all  things  and

leading  to  the  harmony  of  nature  and  man.  It  can  be  combined  with  favoring  the  intimate,

reverencing the superior, repaying, and karma to form the operating principle of filial piety.

72

Regarding integrativeness, in response to the mystery of the positive and negative effects

of filial piety research and bereavement research, this theory explains it based on an emotional

basis, human needs, and psychological mechanisms and cites the theory of Yin and Yang to

unify it. Although "The Dual Filial Piety Model" can also solve the Yang filial piety research

puzzle,  its  explanation  is  not  the  same  as  this  theory.  For  example,  this  theory  looks  at

"reciprocal  filial piety"  and "authoritative filial piety"  on the horizontal and vertical  axes.  It

believes that "reciprocal filial piety" has equal Status in the parent-child relationship and treats

each other as unique individuals, similar to the emotional basis and interactive relationship of

the  friendship  model  (English,  1979;  Tsao  &  Yeh,  2019),  or  a  similar  "equal  match"

interpersonal  interaction  prototype.  This  point  of  view  places  "reciprocal  filial  piety"  and

"authoritative filial piety" in a status dimension comparison. This theory is not the case. Instead,

it looks at  "filial piety shared by the group" and "filial piety in  the authority position" from

different perspectives. It believes the former is based on blood relations and produces group

preference  and  reciprocal  altruism.  In  contrast,  the  latter  is  based  on  status,  authority,  and

resources, resulting in status superiority and resource giving and receiving. According to this,

only "filial piety in the authority position" contains a status dimension, but "filial piety shared

by the group" does not.

No theory can be perfect without flaws or limitations, and "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory"

is  no  exception.  First,  as  mentioned  above,  everyone  experiences  Yang  Filial  Piety,  but

relatively few people experience Yin Filial Piety. The development trajectory of Yang Filial

Piety is relatively straightforward, and the starting point of Yin Xiao is highly variable. This

adds a lot of difficulties to experimental design and data interpretation. For example, each age

group's  life  experience  and  mood  must  be  different,  so  the  behavioral  manifestations  and

psychological mechanisms of bereavement in adolescents, adults, middle-aged, and even old

age may differ. However, "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory" does not distinguish the similarities

and differences.

Furthermore, bereavement includes the loss of a dependent, the loss of a parent, and the

death of both parents. These three types' connotations of yin filial piety (emotional basis, power

source, operating mechanism, and effect performance) may be subtly different. However, "Yin-

Yang Filial Piety Theory" does not differentiate between the three. Finally, "Yin-Yang Filial

Piety Theory" uses bereavement as a critical event and divides the development of filial piety

into two stages: Yin Filial Piety and Yang Filial Piety, but there may be more than these two

stages.  For  example,  adolescence  (rebellion  period),  adulthood  (financial  independence),

marriage, and having children (as a parent, empathize) can also be used as critical events to

73

divide  the  development  of  filial  piety  into  different  stages,  and  each  of  these  stages  has  its

unique connotation of filial piety. "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory" does not consider these key

life  events  (which  may  significantly  impact  filial  piety).  In  the  future,  we  may  be  able  to

continue to deepen the "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory" based on these shortcomings.

5. Future Research Directions

This  article  proposes  the  concept  of  Yin  Filial  Piety  and  the  transformation  of  yin  and

Yang in filial piety. In the future, qualitative research can be conducted to interview the children

of Yin Filial Piety and ask about their filial attitudes when their parents were alive and their

mood changes after bereavement. Then, based on this exploration data, the "Yin-Yang Filial

Piety Scale" was further compiled. Here, we take the children of Yin Filial Piety as a sample.

The Yin Filial Piety scale is fine, but the Yang Filial Piety scale may be biased because, for the

children of Yin Filial Piety, those Yang Filial Piety items are a thing of the past and cannot be

practiced. To recall the  situation, it is  "virtual,"  so  it cannot  be applied to  Yang  Filial Piety

children, so the scale is "virtual Yang filial piety scale." Therefore, the "real Yang filial piety

scale" should be compiled using the children of Yang Filial Piety as samples. At the same time,

those Yin filial piety items have not yet occurred for the children of Yang filial piety. They are

hypothetical and "virtual," so the "virtual  Yang filial piety scale" can be recompiled. In this

way, there are four scales: "real Yang filial piety," "virtual Yang filial piety," "real Yin filial

piety," and "virtual Yin filial piety," which can be used or compared with each other according

to the research purpose and objects.

The transformation of yin and yang in "filial piety shared by the group" is more in line

with common sense and reality. It is human nature to turn from love to sorrow and to feel guilty

after losing a loved one. In comparison, the transformation of "filial piety shared by the group"

changes from awe to remorse and regret, and the effect changes from negative to positive. The

reason seems not so straightforward and clear. This theory believes that its transformation is

through "liberation" and "compensation", as well as the operation of "the repay principle" and

"the principle of Tao". How to confirm this is particularly critical.

Take the compensation function as an example. It uses "doing good and eliminating evil"

and "cultivating all things" to repay the dead parents and eliminate the inner guilt. Buddhism

emphasizes  compassion  and  altruism,  so  you  can  consider  taking  Buddhists  as  samples  and

dividing them into two groups, Yang Filial Piety Buddhists and Yin Filial Piety Buddhists, and

ask them what their motivations for doing good deeds are or who they mainly dedicate to you

74

can also design questions to ask them Choose, for example, dedicated to sentient beings, lovers,

parents, friends, everything in the universe, etc., and then compare the differences between the

two groups. Since the parents of Buddhists of Yang Filial Piety are still alive, there are many

ways to perform filial piety to their parents directly, and the compensation function is useless;

on  the  contrary,  if  the  parents  of  Buddhists  of  Yin  Filial  Piety  have  passed  away,  the

compensation function starts to operate. Therefore, this theory predicts that Yang Filial Piety

Buddhists are likelier to dedicate their good deeds to sentient beings. At the same time, Yin

Filial Piety Buddhists are more likely to dedicate their good deeds to their parents. In addition,

since  Chinese  society  is  deeply  influenced  by  Buddhism,  its  teachings,  such  as  karma  and

dedication, are widely adopted, so non-Buddhists can also be used as samples. This theory also

predicts  that  Yin  Filial  Piety  children  will  turn  to  their  parents  more  than  Yang  Filial  Piety

children.

In addition to scale administration, priming studies can also be used. First, we divide the

children into Yang Filial Piety children and Yin Filial Piety children. Ask them to describe their

parents  (priming  parents’  group)  or  neutral  characters  with  nothing  to  do  with  their  parents

(control group). This is a 2×2 design. Then, design situations that allow participants to perform

altruistic behaviors (donating money or helping others), which is the dependent variable. This

theory predicts that there will be an interaction effect, and the philanthropic behavior of the

parent group will be more than that of the neutral group, mainly contributed by the children of

Yin Filial Piety; this is because the children of filial piety feel guilty for their dead parents, so

they  have  a  compensatory  effect,  which  is  reflected  in  their  behavior.  Good  deeds,  but  the

children of Yang Xiao do not have such psychological conditions (because their parents are still

alive). The above only outlines possible practical research directions.

In short, future research on filial piety based on the "Yin-Yang Filial Piety Theory" should

especially focus on "Yin Filial Piety" and the transformation process from Yang Filial Piety to

Yin Filial Piety. This study integrates the divergent results of previous filial piety research and

bereavement  research  on  positive  and  negative  effects,  deepens  the  concept  of  filial  piety,

expands  the  research  fields  of  filial  piety  and  bereavement,  and  hopes  to  contribute  to

indigenous social sciences (especially indigenous counseling psychology).

從大學生命教育的角度來認識具象思維與教學態度

摘要

本文從大學生的自我認同已不再是知識份子出發來思考，觀察到知識本身對大學生

不再有理想性的意義，而只有工具性的意義。當教師是知識菁英，學生卻不再是知識份

子，這使得臺灣高等教育內教師與學生因知識的巨大鴻溝，正存在某種「隱而未宣」的

緊張關係。大學生普遍存在「知識指向就業」且「就業指向賺錢」的教養與認知，當獲

得知識不再等於探索高深學問，則純知識性的探索適足以引發學生的反感，這種「反知

識的事實」使得我們思索大學生需要什麼內容的生命教育，大學教師本身需要有更深刻

的同理與共情，從謙卑的態度來體會大學生的具體需要，從事教學工作時則應該暫時擱

置個人對知識的喜好傾向，不應該再奢談抽象思維的議題，而應該從具象思維來引領教

學，其教學方法則可自如運用於問題本位學習法、行動學習法與服務學習法，教學則應

該秉持著心學態度，意即對照宋明儒學中的心學家使用反知識的路徑來解構卻擴張知識，

裨益學生在活潑的互動教學中對學習有感，教師唯有主動跨出來關注學生，讓生命與生

命相見，拿自己的誠意來教學，真實聆聽發生在學生身上的問題，共築融洽無間有如書

院古風的師生關係。

關鍵詞：生命教育、知識份子、具象思維、心學態度、教學方法

當前大學生需要什麼內容的生命教育？筆者曾在「2015 兩岸大專校院生命教育高

峰論壇」做過相關觀點的闡釋（陳復，2015），後再經修改成本文。如果把這個問題放

在臺灣當前高等教育的發展實況來檢視，或許會有更清晰的答案。臺灣各大學正呈現的

高等教育危機，不只體現在因出生率驟降導致大學入學率遽減，更體現在大學教育正劇

烈轉型為職業教育，大學不再作為闡發學術理念並落實學術發展的殿堂，除研究型大學

視教師發表在國際期刊的數量作為研究績效指標，導致學者競相聯合發表輕薄短打的專

題論文，甚至有相互掛名徵引論文或依附大老掛名其人卻未實際參與研究的現象（最嚴

重的案例莫過於陳震遠論文審稿造假 60 篇論文，並讓教育部長蔣偉寧掛名 5 篇，事發
後最終令蔣部長下台）18，成為著重技術取勝而不在意研究宏旨的學術工匠；教學型大

學則視學生畢業後能否獲得工作為教學績效指標，並重視產學合作的量化成果，裨益學

涯與職涯的無縫接軌，提高畢業生未來就業率成為這類大學在教學期間的唯一考量。這

兩大特徵使得本來具有歐洲古典意義的「大學精神」正大幅滑落19，當高等教育不再著

重於從事深度的研究與廣度的教學，顯而易見的現象反映在大學生的自我認同裡不再有
「知識份子」（intellectual）的意義20，從最核心的定義來說，其不再如過往的知識份子

會闡釋與宣傳某種前瞻性的觀點，更不在意基於社會關懷而從事較大格局的實踐，只在

意如何獲得較容易的「小確幸」（しょうかっこう，出自春上村樹的用語）21，面對就

業卻更有無所適從的徬徨。大學生面對人生呈現「理想的失焦」，呈現臺灣各大學發展

過程裡最嚴峻的一章。

18  這是民國 103 年 7 月爆發的學術醜聞事件，蔣偉寧部長於事件爆發後第四天（7 月 14 日）辭職。這種
相互掛名現象與掛名原則的擬訂與學術倫理有關，如何解決當前學界只重視論文數量不重視論文品質的
問題，同樣屬於生命教育應亟思的課題，相關內容各大報都有報導，如見於《蘋果日報》（「論文醜聞燒四
天，蔣偉寧終於下台」，2014）。
19  黃光國教授指出（2013，4-6 頁），臺灣正呈現邊陲資本主義社會的特徵：其根據國外的需求，以「原
裝設備加工」（original equipment manufacturing，OEM）的辦法來生產單一產品；而不是根據國內的需求，
做技術的創新。他並指出：大多數邊陲國家雖然有所謂的「大學」，然而，大學的主要任務並不是在推動
文化體系的合理化，而是在訓練其「加工生產體系」的維修人員，這樣的大學並不能說是西方意義的大
學，充其量只能算是訓練技術人才或維修工程師的技術學校而已。
20  如果當前大學生更關注自己如何成為時尚名模、美食達人、新聞主播、明星歌手……，對於社會公共
事件很快在臉書按讚表示支持或反對，但當這些議題需要嚴肅對待與討論卻常呈現留白，只在意個人具
體權益問題，卻對於社會整體福祉表現得很淡漠，這就很難稱作知識份子。早在民國 68 年，金耀基教授
就針對今日的「知識人」應該有怎樣的修養特別指出（2003，79-80 頁）：「我們以為二十世紀『知識人』
一種合理的信仰是科學的人文主義。他應該知道自然世界與人文世界的關係，並通過科學與技術以建立
並豐富以人為主體本位的人文世界。」如欲實踐這樣的理想，大學教育就不能只著重培育大學生成為「技
術人」，卻漠視科學與人文的平衡。
21  如果我們只就職業類別來認知何謂知識份子，則知識份子的「專業」就是「提出觀點」，這是種來自西
洋文化的典型看法，如美國政治學家湯瑪斯索爾（Thomas Sowell，1930-）指出「知識份子不需要對外在
世界負任何責任」，其工作就是基於各自智能提供各種觀點來給世人參考（Sowell, 2010/2014, pp. 14-23）；
當然，知識份子概念具有相當大的歧義性，或如將知識份子這個舶來的概念拿來理解中國傳統的「士」，
則大陸岑紅教授指出中國傳統知識份子具有相當濃厚的「公共性」，其立足於群體共在的「學統」，面向或
置身於統治的「政統」，冀圖實踐著基於儒家思想發展出的「道統」，由於肩負著「道」的使命，故將政治
道德化，憑藉著超世間的精神來過問世間的事情（岑紅，2014，291-310 頁）。

其實，大學生畢業後，即使再就讀研究所，畢業後都需要面臨就業問題，職業生涯

是每個人一生都需要正面對待的生命課題，問題的癥結就出現在這本來是個生命課題，

卻被當作技術課題來處理，致使大學開設各種職業培訓課程，卻沒有注意到人的生命素

質該如何培育與養成，當學生根本不認識自己是誰，對自己的人生感到茫然失措，整日

只是渾渾噩噩的過日子，平日不論人在哪裡都忙著滑手機，使得人每個正在現場的當下

都如同「不在」，當人變成只知專業知識卻沒有生命素養的技術人22，請問他如何能做

出精確的職涯抉擇（甚至學涯抉擇），替自己這輩子的人生負責呢？或甚至該如何避免

其因為沒有豐厚的生命素養，對社會不聞不問，甚至不惜運用專業知識做出傷害社會的

事情？這就是大學不能不在通識教育開設各類生命教育課程的原因。但大學生需要什麼

內容與型態的生命教育呢？生命教育本身具有跨領域的性質，如果教師只從自己的專業

知識來談生命教育，尤其將生命教育教成哲學概論或宗教概論，只講內容高度抽象的哲

理或教理，這就難免脫離大學生實際在面對的生命世界（life  world）23，更難吸引大學

生的眼球離開手機，因此，認識大學生需要生命教育的內容與型態，從中架構出精確對

應的「微觀世界」（micro world），這個議題相當值得討論，更是華人社會發展生命教

育過程裡不可不處理的環節。

從這個角度出發，我們就需要回過來討論生命教育的屬性問題。首先，我們來釐清：

開設生命教育課程的重點對象在教師、課程、教材抑或學生？我們很自然會指出四者都

有，其實關鍵在比例偏重的問題。如果重點擺在教師，教師素質確實會大幅影響生命教

育課程的品質，且教師如藉由生命教育課程的準備，身心都獲得大幅成長，就教師增能

的層面而言誠屬相當正面的事情，但這門課最關鍵的成長者如果在教師端，很難不引發

吾人下面的疑惑：學生在學習過程中究竟是如何獲得改變？如果重點擺在課程，生命教

育課程本不需要過度承載其他(cid:13706)有專業領域的知識內容，令其他課程的典範不知不覺轉

移到這門課程裡，而應該尊重自己教育的重點在關注具體不斷在變化的「生命」，這使

得課程設計實不能太固著於結構面，而忽略掉師生在課程內具體感知到施與受這類真實

反應。如果重點擺在教材，則生命教育的教材本來應該設計得多元活潑，但任何教材的

設計者主要在教師，如果教師本身不能針對學生的實際情況提供教材來適性教學，則任

何精美的教材都會產生教與學落差的問題（譬如在學生因使用大量手機，已習慣視聽影

22  楊國樞教授早在十五年前就指出（1999，11 頁）：「從大學教育的目標及通識教育的意義來看，大學教
育絕不可流為『訓練教育』或『技術教育』，大學教育不能窄化為職業訓練教育。」李家同教授同樣針對
大學不該成為「職業訓練所」做三點建議（1999，16-18 頁）：（一）過份強調「實用」技術本來就不切實
際；（二）太過專業而無宏觀，將嚴重限制學生的事業發展；（三）大學生必須關懷人類的重大問題。
23  有關「生命世界」是相對於「微觀世界」而言，最早出自前蘇聯心理學家維高斯基（Lev Vygotsky, 1896-
1934）發現學校教授高度抽象的內容與兒童來自家庭裡的常識兩者會相互衝擊與轉化，容納到兒童本來
的生命世界內，兒童得要用自己熟悉的語言作為工具，將這些知識「同化」（assimilate）到(cid:13706)有認知系統，
或改變(cid:13706)有認知系統，來「順化」（accommodate）這些新知識（Lev Vygotsky, 1978；黃光國，2014，3-4
頁）。但，如果當前的大學生不再願意順化這些知識，將其容納到本來的生命世界內呢？這就會發生教學
困境。

86

音的社會環境裡，過度播放影音節目來當作教材，只會產生視聽倦怠的現象）。(cid:13706)然如

此，則學生顯然就是生命教育課程最關鍵的對象，畢竟學習的主體首在學生，儘管教師、

課程與教材都依然是不可忽視的重要環節。而且，教師不應該只從自身的專業領域出發

來單向傳授學生某個角度的生命教育（譬如將本該具有多元面向的生命課講授成單一面

向的哲學課，儘管其間不可能沒有哲學義理的探索），反而應該從學生具體置身的生命

世界出發，來討論生命在這些變化萬千的處境中，學生該有如何「向外應對」與「向內

自處」的原則與辦法。

只要有關於「向外應對」與「向內自處」的原則與辦法，這就涉及到生活倫理的議

題，不就應該溯源到支撐各種倫理後面的哲學或宗教的理念？這的確是不容我們忽視的

事實，但這些內容只是屬於「知識的事實」（intellectual fact），卻同時存在著「反知識

的事實」（anti-intellectual fact），這點同樣不容我們忽視。我們需要嚴密注意目前在臺

灣高等教育內教師與學生正存在某種「隱而未宣」的緊張關係，當前大學教師普遍已拿

到博士學位，沒有任何理由懷疑這些人不屬於真正的知識菁英（intellectual elite），但如

前面所言，大學生卻不再是知識份子，知識本身對大學生不再有理想性的意義，而只有

工具性的意義，意即在大學生慣有的教養與認知裡，「知識指向就業」且「就業指向賺

錢」，當獲得知識不再等於探索高深學問（意即為學問而學問），則純知識性的探索是

足以引發學生的反感，尤其當這件事情與專業知識無關，無法直接回答就業與賺錢這類

的問題。儘管這是當前大學生視野日漸窄化醞釀出來的結果，如果推演這個脈絡的說法

無誤，則當前大學教師在生命教育課程內講授任何有關哲學或宗教的抽象知識，都已很

難引起學生的興趣，學生學習的心態不再是知識本身，而在不知不覺間滑向極度有關於

現實利害的目的（學習專業知識與通識知識都是如此），這就是我們就學生層面不能不

正視已存在著一股強烈「反知識的事實」。

這種反知識的事實，加上吸收資訊（學習資源）的多元化，尤其網路與其閱聽工具

的便利，使得學生更習慣於大量觀看影音視頻（尤其是具有娛樂性的各種影音視頻），

而不再喜歡「聽老師講課」，且不說教師單向演講授課作為教學方法是否適宜，演講授

課的性質與內容理應具有相當的知識承載量，但訊息如果未經內化思辨的過程並不等於

知識，當學生更慣於「接收娛樂性的訊息」，不慣於「探討嚴肅性的知識」，這種學習

娛樂化的傾向，使得反知識的事實就更加凸顯於課堂，且最常見的現象就是當教師受制

於每學期的教學反應問卷，則如果通識教育開課單位如果不做任何限制，課程內容將會

更加媚俗化（這主要是指提供娛樂性的訊息），藉此交換出「皆大歡喜」的結果，這種

令人困窘的民粹現象同樣是種反知識的事實，卻因為屬於新發展的現象，尚未被相關教

學者與研究者重視。學生不再具有知識份子的自我認同，教師則跟著不知不覺喪失知識

份子的風骨，頗值得反省這個問題：當前大學生普遍存在的屬性定位到底是什麼呢？筆

者覺得如使用「普羅大眾」（proletariat）這個詞彙比較適合拿來理解大學生，這個詞彙

87

如果用資本主義的角度來詮釋，則應能解釋做「流行文化的跟風者」；如果用共產主義

的角度來詮釋，則應能解釋做「無產階級的勞動者」，就這兩種角度出發來理解當前大

學生的屬性與處境各有其深意，只有當人需要藉由大量的工作都不易換取較高額的薪資，

則就業與賺錢這類問題纔會特別嚴重，並被學生視作人生亟需解決的事情，這種現象從

大學生就學期間就已經長期在「打工」已可看出端倪。這時候大學教師如繼續無視於師

生間因生活與經濟層面的持續落差，隱然存在著知識的巨大鴻溝，忽略彼此在知識間的

緊張關係，對學生面臨的困境無感，依然故我講授自己高深的知識，並對學生因打工而

聽課聽到睡著倍感憤怒，則就學生的角度來看，該教師實在難免給人有種「不知民生疾

苦」的距離感。

壹、從抽象思維回到具象思維的路徑

基於前面的脈絡，我們不免發現當前大學教師置身於極其困難的處境：如果教師不

願意媚俗，淨講著「自得其樂」的知識，就極可能會帶給學生「不知民生疾苦」的距離

感；如果教師很樂意媚俗，淨大量播放影音來娛樂學生，則大學老師不啻於自甘沈淪。

在兩難的處境裡，是否有任何「兩全其美」的辦法呢？筆者覺得，當我們思索大學生需

要什麼內容的生命教育，大學教師需要有更深刻的同理與共情，從謙卑的態度，彎腰來

體會大學生的具體需要，而不是只從自己的角度來要求學生「擴張視野」，能立刻領會

高深知識的堂奧，大學教師更不應該擺著知識的傲慢，使得學生對知識望而生畏。教師

自身從事研究工作時當然要繼續開拓知識的深度，從(cid:13706)有的知識來展開新知識的孕育過

程裡，更要注意學術概念的清晰度24；但在從事教學工作時，則應該暫時擱置個人對知

識的喜好傾向，不應該再繼續純奢談抽象思維的議題，反而應該從思考範圍更具寬闊性

的「具象思維」（embodied thinking）來引領教學，畢竟生命教育課程有別於傳統課程著
重於知識與資訊的汲取，應該成為促進全人發展的人格教育25。何謂具象思維呢？思維

或可區隔出動作思維（action thinking）、形象思維（imagery thinking）和抽象思維（abstract

thinking）這三種型態。動作思維是人類各種思維演變和發展的基石，具象思維的型塑從

動作思維開始。動作思維是藉由各種動作與感覺來解決問題的思維，其伴隨著直觀與具

體的動作展開。譬如幼兒出生後對母親身體與氣息會發展出識別與依戀，母親則只要看

見幼兒嘴巴在吸吮與哭泣就知道其肚子餓要餵奶，這就是動作思維。即使在成人階段，

24  黃光國教授（2013，13-14 頁）從事並提倡華人本土心理學研究，來自他發現學術常存在某種「質化研
究的迷惘」：研究者根本沒有明顯的問題意識，不懂得如何建立實質性的理論，隨意找到個「新鮮花俏」
的研究題目，卻喜歡用朦朧曖昧的文字，夾雜引用國外著名學者重要的學術概念，任何支解扭曲，卻不能
讓讀者理解作者到底要說什麼。這種類型的研究本身無法讓知識獲得推展。
25  吳秀碧教授（2010，47-50 頁）指出：「傳統科目以知識與資訊，以及技巧的獲得為主；生命教育課程
則以自我發展為核心的人格教育。在教學目標、教學主題、教材和學習方法各方面的安排，都必須考量學
生的認知階段特徵、人格發展階段特徵、年齡階段生活需要等因素。」

88

人對身體反應各種具體感知，如痛覺、溫覺、觸覺、視覺、聽覺與味覺……，有個具體

外物作為對象，藉由該媒介來引發人的思維，這就是具象思維的初級階段（魏玉龍，2009，

18-20 頁）。

成人在具象思維的初級階段會因為熟練程度的提高而快速運作，但只要與各種覺受

發生關聯，其就僅是物質性的具象思維；但當具象思維不再有外物作為對象，往心靈的

想像開展，就會發展出精神性的具象思維。在討論精神性的具象思維前，我們首先來討

論形象思維。形象思維是指具體的形象或圖像作為人思維的內容與型態，這同樣是人的

一種本能思維，其表達的工具常是感官體會的圖像符號。形象思維常具有整體性的優點，

使得思維很快從整體來把握住問題，其不僅會在思維裡對(cid:13706)有形象的重現，更會對(cid:13706)有

形象展開加工，從而產生新的產出（如各種工藝作品的呈現），這使得形象思維的優點

就在於呈現人生命的創造性，文明藉由這個過程獲得開展（魏玉龍，2009，18-20 頁）。

由這裡可知，動作思維的繼續發展就是形象思維，然形象思維比動作思維更具有精神的

高度，儘管其通常還需要藉由外物作為對象來思維，其同樣還是種物質性的具象思維，

但當形象思維懂得「得魚忘荃」，意即思維到達某個高度，不再仰賴外物作為對象，能

純粹開展心靈的想像，這就接著發展出精神性的具象思維。不論動作思維或形象思維，

都屬於具象思維的內容，只是人的思維常停留在物質性的階段，使得該兩種思維未具與

抽象思維分庭抗禮的高度，這就是往日西洋文化會特別獨尊抽象思維（概念化思考）的

主因，換個角度來說，這是西洋文化發展過程裡迥異於人類文明常態樣貌的一大特徵。

抽象思維是人在認識活動中運用概念來推理與判斷這類思維，來對客觀現實進行間

接與概括的反映過程。本來就西洋文化脈絡來檢視，抽象思維是獲取知識的辦法，只有

藉由抽象思維將「主客對立」變成思維主軸，纔能使得外物作為對象獲得語言架構出深

化認識，當然這個概念同樣可反過來說，主客對立的意識使得抽象思維獲得開展。但具

象思維發展出精神性的思維高度，主要來自中華文化脈絡，最典型的例證莫過於中醫。

中國醫學相當強調體驗，從「神農嚐百草」這則傳說開始，中國醫學家與藥學家就開始

從體驗的角度來識別中藥屬性，並衡量人與藥兩者間有如何的對應關係，從而產生「八

綱辨證的論斷（八綱是指陰陽、寒熱、表裡與虛實這四對性質相反的證候），並對人體

的臟腑經絡與氣血津液間的關係有各種豐富的感覺，發展脈診這種藉由醫者與病者相互

體驗來診斷病情的辦法，這顯然已不再是簡單的動作思維，更不僅是圖像做主宰的形象

思維，其心靈的想像展開脫離對象的運轉與判斷，只能從精神性的具象思維來解釋。中

醫典籍如《黃帝內經‧陰陽應象大論》中闡釋「應象」就具有「感應」與「對應」這兩種

意思。感應是主體體驗，對應則是客體推理，前者具有主客合一的特徵，後者具有主客

對立的特徵，但具象思維本身不能排除抽象思維，其依然具有運用概念來推理與判斷的

意義，只不過具象思維在感應層面有著細緻發展的脈絡，使其產生不同於抽象思維的獨

立特點（魏玉龍，2009，18-20 頁）。中西思維型態演化歷程請見圖 1：

圖 1

中西思維型態演化歷程圖

當我們理解中華文化本來有具象思維的特點，回過來從事於大學生命教育教學工作

具有如何的意義呢？筆者覺得教師不宜再只是從自己的抽象知識出發從事「課程本位學

習法」（curriculum-based learning），教師需要具體感應與對應自己面對的學生，相互體

驗彼此最真實的身心狀態，適時給予精確的回應，從討論的過程裡發展生命教育，意即

「對話」（dialogue）應該要作為課程發展最重要的事情，讓彼此的真實想法在對話中展

現。耶魯大學前校長惠特尼‧格理斯沃（Whitney Griswold）將「對話」做這番定義：「一

種了不起的創造性藝術，人類藉此詮釋感受，將其化為理性，進而與同儕分享這些賴以

建立的內心深層想法與理念。」（Zakarid, 2015/2016, p. 56）筆者覺得這番說法顯示他認

為的對話具有具象思維的特點，教師要承認自己在面對活潑真實的「生命」，不再只是

面對無生命的外物作為對象，主體與客體都會有各種身心反應的變化，需要教師秉持著

誠意，如中醫「脈診」般開出「藥單」，給出最能有益於學生的「治療法」。由於學生

沒反映出自己的任何問題，則教師無從得知學生的具體情況，因此教師可採取「問題本

位學習法」（problem-based  learning，簡稱 PBL），藉由結構模糊的問題來作為學習情

境，讓學生有機會扮演問題的持有者（stake-holder），主動應用學習整合新舊知識，合

作討論提出問題並尋覓答案，來共同架構課程的內容（楊淳皓，2012，2-12 頁）。這種

歷程實屬「鬆動知識的結構」來「展開知識的重構」，但這只是第一個層面，接著，教

師藉由學生提供的答案來衡量學生目前知識程度，適時給予某種反問，來引發學生繼續

思考；或故意給出依據該答案產生的懸疑情境，來引發學生繼續發問，都能大幅引發學

生的學習動機，這都是屬於對話的具體實踐。

90

接著，筆者還想闡釋「行動學習法」（action learning）。行動學習法是對傳統課室

教學的重大調整，當學習對象不再只是課本，而是具體的「人、事、時、地、因」，英

文稱作 5W（who, what, when, where, why）要領，教學生直接在實踐的過程裡，通過掌

握相關知識來面對具體問題，從而釐清問題的存在本質與引伸現象。就筆者實際在生命

教育課程實施行動學習法的教學經驗來說，如教導學生順著思路繪製心智圖（mind map），

接著讓學生自行在教案紙拿蠟筆繪畫有關「我是誰」的心智圖，學生藉由動手畫圖的過

程裡展開對自己的感覺性認識，從而對自己面臨的具體問題產生反省。從認識自己往外

延伸，教師可展開如「我能否相信你：眼盲心不盲」的互動練習：請學生在第一節課，

每組的組員都用白毛巾蒙上眼睛，雙手搭著前一人的肩，由組長帶領大家往教室該層樓

來往走一圈，最後全組回到教室，藉此培養組員對組長的信任感；回來後，全班每個人

彼此選擇一位伙伴，兩人一組，輪流一人用白毛巾蒙上眼睛；一人引領他在校園裡走路，

時間大約 20 分鐘，結束後再交換體驗。回到教室後，大家在教案紙用蠟筆畫出「眼盲

心不盲」的「心象」，意即你在被帶領或引領人的過程裡，腦海中浮現出的畫面。我們

從教學反應評量可看出這種情境練習頗能培養學生的團隊默契與生命體驗。但這只是個

起點，更具有實踐性的行動學習譬如教師設計「發現校園角落裡的垃圾里程」這個教案，

告知學生要展開小組的「漂鳥行程」，引領學生第一堂課到校園發現校園角落裡的垃圾

里程，藉此完成行動學習，具體辦法是教師請每個小組的成員事先準備垃圾袋，並攜帶

用過的免洗竹筷或用過的塑膠手套，大家共同在校園裡尋覓，觀察在哪個角落有「不為

人知」的垃圾，接著，請同學們看著這個令人疑惑的垃圾，共同討論這個垃圾的里程，

包括五點問題：（1）它是誰製造的東西？（2）它本來存在於哪裡？（3）它是否對人體

有益？（4）它被誰購買與丟棄？（5）最適合於它的歸宿？大家共同集思廣益，確認這

個垃圾最終該有的里程，然後用各自準備的工具拾起垃圾放進垃圾袋裡。各組收集到的

垃圾種類或數量不限，重點是整個討論與實踐的品質。教師會請學生在第二堂課上課打

鈴前回到教室，討論 5 分鐘後，讓各組報告自己的「發現」，最後，請學生完成這些垃

圾的最後歸宿，將其丟棄到最適合的資源回收桶內，經過這個「垃圾變黃金」的奇幻漂

流後，再請學生拿蠟筆畫出這段令人難忘的歷程，學生常會表示自己從來沒有使用這種

視野來觀察自己每天置身其中的校園。

最後，筆者還要探討服務學習法（service learning）對生命教育的意義。該學習法本

來不限於通識教育，卻相當適合通識教育有關生命教育的教學，其強調「服務」與「學

習」這兩端的相互結合，在服務的過程中獲得學習效益。學生在這種型態的教育裡，參

與經過縝密規劃的社會性服務與結構化設計，應用學校所學的知識與技能，結合該社區

民眾的需求，在其間學習反思（reflection）和互惠（reciprocity），藉此提昇學習成效，

反思是指學生在服務學習過程中對問題的思考與省察，互惠則意指學生不再僅把被服務

者視為被幫助的對象，更是自己從中省察與成長的泉源，並使得包含學生、學校與社區

91

這三端都發生改變與進展（Jacoby & Associates, 1996, pp. 5-7）。服務學習就是種體驗型

學習，尤其能面向社會來展開學習，更可從班杜拉（Albert Bandura, 1925-）主張的社會

學習理論（social learning theory）來理解，他認為人類的學習是個人與社會持續交互作

用的歷程。人類的行為大都經由學習而來，個體自出生就無時無刻甚或不知不覺學習他

人的行為，隨著年齡的增長，在行動、思想、感覺與對事物的看法，終於變成一個為家

庭及社會所接受的人（任朝霞、陳萍，2004）。因此，引領學生接觸社會各種真實的風

貌，這能引發學生深刻的體驗，譬如當筆者帶領學生到國立宜蘭特殊教育學校從事服務

學習，讓學生幫忙整理園藝如裁剪花草插到孩子的盆栽罐裡；或幫忙推著癱瘓的孩子坐

輪椅在校園巡禮並曬著陽光；或與孩子共同彩繪創作手工書；或幫忙孩子清洗汽車；或

與孩子調製販售飲料；或協助孩子電腦文書處理；或帶領學生參加該校舉辦的校際拔河

比賽與盲人棒球比賽……，大學生藉由服務這些有特殊障礙的孩子，藉由回饋單得知其

普遍對生命產生更深刻的體驗，從這些孩子身上學會人能活著何其不易，從而回想父母

生養自己的含辛茹苦，人應該更珍惜生命，這顯然比純粹講論儒家思想的抽象觀念更能

直指人的心底，顯見體驗型學習確實有其效益。

大陸學者歐陽康教授曾經討論過其學校教育長期呈現的「教育錯位」：幼稚園的時

候急著教小學的課，小學的時候急著教中學的課，中學的時候急著教大學的課，等到大

學的時候發現還要回過頭來教幼稚園的課，要大學生學會如何說話與做人，懂得禮貌的

文明舉止，但由於大學生的行為規範早就形成，這時候還要展開基礎的素質教育就相當

困難了（歐陽康，2015，92-94 頁）。這種現象臺灣何嘗不是如此？生命教育誠然需要

規劃如何從學前到大學如何循序漸進的通盤實施，但，如果我們覺得在高等教育要展開

直指學生具體問題的生命教育實有困難就猶豫不前，這同樣不是大學教師面對教育應該

秉持的態度。歐陽康教授覺得真正的生命教育應當是自我教育，引導大學生從被動的受

人教育者轉化為主動的自我教育者，讓大學生懂得不斷自我追問，教師則應該從演講型

的老師變成教練型的老師，不再只耽溺於獨白的自我表現與自我欣賞，要與學生共同摸

爬滾打，讓學生藉由上課來表演生命，從中體悟與自覺生命的進展，他覺得這種教練型

的老師要能回應學生提出的生存問題，解讀他們在生命歷程中面臨的困難與困惑（歐陽

康，2015，92-94 頁）。筆者覺得如果在教學方法層面採取活動而不是演講的型態來從

事教學，讓學生在教師設計的情境中學習，更能裨益教師精確扮演教練的角色，並能讓

學生感受到學習的有趣。

貳、教師在反知識事實裡的教學態度

前面指出具象思維最典型的體現來自中國醫學，中國醫學強調體驗，使得其醫學知

識並不是獨立於人外面的抽象知識（abstract knowledge），而是內在於人裡面的經驗知

92

識（experiential knowledge）。經驗知識是重視親身實感的內隱知識，常經由學習或重複

練習而得，例如學騎車或學游泳的經驗，人將感受到的認知具體化，從而醞釀出「知」

的過程與現象，在不知不覺中，這個「知」已變成個體內隱的思想或技能，與累積經驗

卻抽離經驗，用語言將其知概念化的外顯知識（意即抽象知識）有著不同的知識。體驗

的過程自然會有個對象，使得人感覺其存在的各種徵候，體驗的發生來自人我間具有共

容且交融的東西，意即有個流動不息而無法實見的存在，傳統中國思想稱作「氣」，具

象思維如果從心理生理學的角度來觀察，就是人的神經系統把外來訊息（informations）

送至意識中樞的能量迴路，聯繫心理與生理來互相變換的能量（湯淺泰雄，2009，63-99

頁），因此，具象思維(cid:13706)具有物質性且具有精神性，其累積與發作，並用語言來闡釋人

的內在體驗，就會醞釀成經驗知識。還有個實際例證，當人在練習氣功的過程裡產生「氣

感」，這並不是將其知覺抽象化為概念，而是來自真實的體驗。當練習者自知「意守丹

田」，這並不是要人著重思考「丹田」這個詞彙，「丹田」本來只是肚臍下面一寸半的

中醫符號，意守丹田不是要人如何認知該符號，而是要將意念放在丹田部位本身，這使

得意守丹田這個練習不再是抽象思維，且不是回憶具體圖象產生的形象思維，更不是任

何具體舉止引發的動作思維，因其藉意念誘導丹田這部位的感覺，人的身體會產生溫熱

的氣感，該氣感會再強化人對丹田的實感，其心理影響生理，生理再影響心理，如此交

互循環，其意識就是具象思維（魏玉龍，2009，18-20 頁）。

雖然我們目前尚沒有大規模的實證依據，然而我們從教學經驗裡不難發現學生具有

「反知識的事實」與「反社會的人格」具有高程度的正相關，美國哈佛大學醫學院瑪莎

史圖特（Martha Stout）博士的研究發現影響反社會人格的環境因素跟文化特徵有關，並

且，往日的研究指出東亞社會（包括日本、大陸與臺灣）反社會人格相當罕見，臺灣存

在的反社會人格者其比率遠低於西洋各國平均 4％，如美國則反社會人格的盛行率卻不

斷在大幅攀高，這與北美文化把個人主義當作核心價值具有高度關係，美國將個人置於

思維主軸其發生反社會人格的傾向遠高於東亞各國強調合群的社會，這主要與東亞文化

擁有壓倒性的信念體系，能讓情感有缺陷的反社會人格者在認知層面獲得彌補，相較於

西洋文化極端強調個人主義的個人控制文化，東亞的文化有種宇宙萬物相互依存的神學

觀，其良知作為人的認知基礎，使得每個人會具有與他人的深度聯繫感（Stout, 2006/2007,

pp. 196-201）。其實，將這種宇宙萬物相互依存的型態稱做「神學觀」難免會有些理解

的誤差（萬物相互依存並不見得來自於人格神的概念），然而不容否認者，東亞文化確

實更重視人我關係與天人關係的和諧，從而內構並擴大「我」的格局與視野，不同於個

人主義的態度，這種態度的核心價值更適合被稱作「關係主義」（relationalism），東亞

各國共同推崇的儒家思想是孕育與影響這種核心價值的主要內涵（黃光國，2009），不

只人與我有著緊密關係，人與天更有著緊密關係。然而，筆者不得不嚴肅指出，這種厚

植於傳統的文化信念，不只已不容易見容於留學西洋諸國，高度仰賴抽象知識傳授系統

93

的大學教師；更因為臺灣自民國 84 年（1995）教育改革二十年對中華文化的拔根工程，

已在年輕一輩大學生的生命世界中消失無蹤，這就自然發展出無道德感與無罪惡感的各

種現象，使得包括臺灣在內東亞諸國因反社會人格而滋生的社會問題正在大幅擴張。

對治這個問題，教師如果只是重拾各種傳統道德的教條來說理，冀圖挽救教師自認

已然沈淪的世道，恐怕只會引發學生強烈的反彈，且與大學素來重視知識教育而不是道

德教育的學術傾向明顯扞格難容。最根本的問題在於華人社會如何讓中西文化獲得和諧

交融，從傳統裡蛻變出新生，更具體來說，如何從華人社會的「生命世界」中藉由對話

萃取出相應的「微觀世界」，架構出本土社會科學來詮釋我們自身的傳統與其正面臨的

問題，這本來是華人社會各大學最應當優先面對與解決的具體課題，並藉由高等教育的

實施令大學生受益，卻持續呈現落空無著落的觀念困境。吾人如持續對這個根本問題的

持續漠視，很難不引發高等教育虛應故事，反覆重演「只教學，不教育」的亂象，這時

候教師面對具有濃厚「普羅大眾」傾向的大學生，恐怕會有強烈的無助感，常呈現老師

在講堂誇誇其談自己的大道理，學生卻隱身且沈湎在自己虛擬的角落裡。接續前面談到

三個具有創新意義的教學法，筆者想釐清這些內容如何蘊含並開啟學生的具象思維。「氣

感產生體驗」這個觀點如拿來解釋生命教育的教學層面，從問題本位學習法而言，當教

師提出結構模糊的問題來作為學習情境，問題本身並不是重點，教師並不是要學生著重

思考問題本身，而只是讓學生感覺我們正面臨的具體問題（產生問題感），藉由滋生對

問題的氣感（讓學生感覺到該問題的真實性），氣感會再強化學生解決問題的實感，如

此周而往復，學生會不斷與自己在漂流的意念對話，感覺這些意念投射到外在的操作性

與實踐性，藉由同儕間的相互討論來刺激思考，就能真正擁有解決問題的信心與本事。

再從行動學習法與服務學習法而言，當學生藉由行動學習或服務學習來掌握知識，

其實踐本身會使得學生產生對具體知識的氣感，這時候開始討論問題就能獲得對問題的

實感，兩者的交互體驗就能推動學習視野的擴張，這是有關對話這件事情內涵的更深度

詮釋。筆者覺得這些具象思維產生的教學法背後，教師本身面對學生秉持的教學態度，

其主軸應該著重在如何幫忙學生打開心靈覺醒，故或宜稱作「心學態度」當更能反映其

深意。其背景脈絡如下：如從中國思想史的角度來觀察，在宋明儒學發展的歷程裡，「理

學」與「心學」這兩種不同的思想路線長期存在著衝突與交融的現象，如果拿《中庸》

第二十七章說：「君子尊德性而道問學，致廣大而盡精微，極高明而道中庸。溫故而知

新，敦厚以崇禮。」（謝冰瑩，1988，53 頁）目前相關研究常指出理學較傾向於「道問

學」這條知識路線；心學則較傾向於「尊德性」這條修養路線，儘管兩種學問同時都納

涵著兩種路線。心學最早可推溯自孟子主張「性善」，北宋程顥開其端，南宋陸九淵則

大啟其門徑，而與同時期理學極大成者朱熹分庭抗禮。至明朝中葉，由深受朱熹影響終

至破繭而出的王陽明首度提出「心學」兩字，使得心學開始有獨立的學術脈絡（陳復，

2012，27-54 頁）。相對於理學重視知識思辨的態度，心學則繼承其脈絡，卻更重視心

94

靈本身的覺醒（開啟良知），意即著重生命的體驗，對知識則採取「(cid:13706)進去，再出來」

的自如風格26，王陽明的心學能獲得廣佈，與其思想能簡單俐落直指人心，使得人願意

從此改變「面對生命的態度」與「觀看生命的思維」，有著極重要關係。他的講學（這

包括講學的型態與講學的內容），就是在從事於生命教育的工作（陳復，2012，27-54 頁），

使得三教九流社會各階層人士只要願意都能學習，纔會使得儒家政治觀念在明朝時期由

「得君行道」往「覺民行道」這種大眾化路線發展（余英時，2004，297-332 頁）。從當

前社會環境需要的角度來思考，不同於理學的學脈已斷絕，心學自明朝中晚葉盛行一百

五十餘年後，在清末民初時期，伴隨著日本明治維新，曾對日本國的富強提供關鍵性的

思想動能，更對清末革命派的孫中山「知難行易說」與維新派的梁啟超「新民說」產生

重要的影響，只可惜華人本身因政治因素，長期沒有完成公民社會該有的風貌，使得民

主政治常質變成民粹政治。如果我們希望在高等教育裡提高大學生的公民素養，裨益未

來發展出更成熟的公民社會，實可借鑒這種直接簡易的心學風格來從事於教學工作，或

對具有「普羅大眾」屬性的大學生更能有益。「道問學」與「尊德性」這儒家兩種學問

路線發展請見圖 2：

圖 2

儒家兩種學問路線發展圖

對知識採取「(cid:13706)進去，再出來」自如的風格，不再執著於表面文字，這就是陸九淵

會質問朱熹說：「堯舜之前何書可讀？」（1980，491 頁）這裡面隱含著堯舜本身並不

靠讀書來成聖，堯舜前的聖人固然無書可讀，堯舜後的聖人同樣不見得只讀書，這並不

是說讀書有錯，但重點並不在讀書，因此陸九淵會教人「發明本心」，王陽明同樣說：

「只此良知無不具足。」（1992，1279 頁）重點只在人信得過良知，自能達成教育的目

26  如果拿王陽明做範例而言，心學家常具有理學素養，卻能不受理學束縛來闡釋直指自家生命的體驗，
這種充滿辯證意義的生命狀態，值得我們後來開設生命教育課程的教師思索如何善用知識卻不受知識束
縛，直接與學生對論與共證彼此生命的體驗。

95

的27，並且，良知的領悟實屬教育第一義，因為這是人內構成「生命世界」的最終根源，

誠如王陽明說：「良知是造化的精靈。這些精靈，生天生地，成鬼成帝，皆從此出，真

是與物無對。人若復得他完完全全，無少虧欠，自不覺手舞足蹈，不知天地間更有何樂

可代。」（《傳習錄》下卷第 61 條，王陽明，1997，139 頁）陸王兩位心學家並未束書

不觀，但心學家會採取反知識的態度來面對知識（如當年王陽明首先龍場悟道後，接著

默記《五經》的言語對證莫不吻合），反過來讓知識獲得解構與擴張，這種態度很適合

用來面對當前大學生的學習困境。心學如反知識，並不意謂反理學，反而要汲取其實質

內涵，更不意謂著徹底無知識，只是其知識的來源不再是抽象知識而是經驗知識，當大

學生存在反知識的現實，對知識學習有倦怠感，寧願每堂課躲到手機裡玩訊息，都不願

意再聽老師的說教，尤其對不能直接回應專業與賺錢的領域欠缺學習動機，這時候教師

開設生命教育課程，如藉由問題本位法、行動學習法與服務學習法，讓學生在親身實踐

的過程裡來體驗生命，更容易開啟學生本來自具的良知。筆者在這裡提出「多重教學典

範」（multiple teaching paradigms）的主張，意即本文雖提出三種教學法，但並不意謂著

只有這三種教學法能呈現教師的心學態度與學生的體驗學習，任何只要從學生本位出發

展開的教學，能幫忙學生把握住自家良知（恢復良知），裨益大學生對學習有感，這都

是生命教育領域值得開發的教學法（儘管這些教學法並不只適用於生命教育，或者可謂

這些教學法即使運用到專業學術領域，都能裨益於學生認識生命），並可稱作屬於具象

思維的實踐。更何況，如果沒有心靈的覺醒，從中展開經驗知識，光只有被灌輸各種抽

象知識，生命未曾內化的結果，如何能確保學生不會出現各種高智慧犯罪的問題呢？教

師應該放棄知識的傲慢，不再自居知識的擁有者來俯視學生，擺出知識譜來跟學生對話，

這只會讓師生間產生無形的隔閡，唯有主動跨出來關注學生，讓生命與生命相見，真實

聆聽發生在學生身上的問題，共築融洽無間有如書院古風的師生關係，這同樣是種心學

態度，這就能讓人回過頭來省思著重生命世界的中華文化對大學生命教育的意義。有關

多重教學典範如何幫忙大學生「恢復良知」，請見圖 3：

圖 3

多重教學典範恢復良知圖

27  余英時教授指出（2004，300 頁）：王陽明顯然要通過喚醒每一個人的「良知」來達成「治天下」的目
的，這可說是儒家政治觀念上一個劃時代的轉變，故與「得君行道」的方向相反，成為轉而關注下面的社
會與平民的內容，故將其稱作「覺民行道」。筆者覺得這層意義同樣可用來施作於教學改革，其最終目的
還是冀圖恢復教育的本衷。

96

        書院係由宋朝至明朝逐漸發展出某種特別的心靈學校，儘管私人辦學並不始自書院，

春秋晚期孔子在魯國曲阜辦學，就具有將學問由王官往下釋放給各階層百姓（國人、野

人甚至奴隸）的歷史意義，整個戰國時期百家異說並立，就是藉由思想家在各國講學，

使社會各階層都產生相當數量的人風行景從，這些思想家各擁主張爭取影響政治的能量，

將理論與實踐結合來開創歷史，不過後世的書院常由思想家在幽靜的山林裡講學，並有

人因生命面臨具體的困惑與困難，期待覓出解答，不辭千里來探問明師的指點，師生共

同在日常生活裡學習，彼此交織休戚與共的關係，有機會則經世濟民，沒機會則修身樂

游，不論仕宦與否，都在奮勉於聖賢的志業。書院與往日私人辦學最顯著的不同，在於

其逐漸發展出一套成熟的學習制度（如宋朝的會講與明朝的講會），經由「天、人、物、

我」這四種層面來陶冶師生的人格，使得人有機會在其間從容探索與面對各種關係，懂

得如何更活潑自在活出有智慧的生命。認識書院存在的意義，同時就在認識中華文化如

何經歷思想家內在轉化與外在傳播的過程，藉由書院對社會發生正面的教育影響，當前

社會實需反思人的心靈覺醒對提高社會整體公民素養的價值，如欠缺書院這種啟發師生

共同往內在探索的教育型態，顯然對高等教育長年持續在傳授技術型的知識，卻不討論

人本身具體面臨的生命難關，終究會滋生嚴重的問題。明朝中晚期心學藉由陽明後學士

人的積極傳播（尤其是王心齋開啟的泰州學派），廣大影響民間，使得各行各業都受到

心學不同程度的影響，儒家思想徹底施展於社會底層，可見心學家灑脫自在的生命風格

具有強大的感染能量，讓包括樵夫與陶匠這些不識字的販夫走卒無不自覺深獲啟發（陳

復，2005，110-113 頁），從這個角度撫今追昔來省察：當前高等教育的大環境固然危

機四伏，我們這些大學教師卻怎能「新亭對泣」，相互嘆息說時不我予，大學生的素養

不高，經師只能繼續對牛彈琴？竺道生說法都能令頑石點頭，我們更應自省：讓知識訊

注意並幫學生點亮心靈的光，這是教師開設生命教育課程應肩負的使命。

The Embodied Thinking and Teaching Manner of Life Education
at University

Chen Fu*

Abstract

From the perspective of college students’ self-identification which they no longer regard

themselves as intellectuals, it is observed by this article that knowledge only serves as a tool

instead  of  an  ideal  for  college  students  nowadays.  There  is  “hidden  and  unspoken”  tension

resulted from the huge gap of knowledge between the instructors as intellectual elites and the

students as utilitarian ones in Taiwan’s higher education system. The cultivation and perception

of “knowledge serves career” and “career serves wealth” are prevalent among college students.

As receiving knowledge is no longer for the pursuit of profound scholarship, students might

feel  antipathy  towards  intellectual  study.  The  “reality  of  anti-intellectualism”  drives  us  to

consider what  kind  of life education is  needed by  our college students.  A college instructor

requires  greater  sympathy  with  humbleness  to  understand  the  actual  demands  of  a  college

student and should set aside personal preferences for knowledge as well as topics involving

abstract thinking when giving instructions. Instead, instructors ought to apply concrete thinking

to teaching practice. Pedagogies such as problem-based learning, action learning, and service

learning can be employed spontaneously while the nouslogy is upheld. Instructors are suggested

to  reflect  the  measure  of  anti-intellectualism  used  by  the  philosophers  of  nousology  in

Confucianism in the Sung and Ming Dynasties, deconstructing knowledge and expanding it for

students  to  be  intrigued  by  learning  activities  during  the  lively  interaction  of  the  teaching

process.  A  harmonious  relationship  between  teachers  and  students,  as  it  existed  in  ancient

academies, can be developed only when instructors take the initiative to care for students, know
each other with their lives, teach them with sincerity, and listen to their problems by heart.

I. Preface

What kind of life education do current college students need? The author once explained

relevant  views  at  the  "2015  Cross-Strait  Life  Education  Summit  Forum  for  Colleges  and

Universities" (Chen, 2015) and later revised this article. If this question is examined based on

the current development of higher education in Taiwan, there may be a more precise answer.

The crisis in higher education that Taiwan's universities are experiencing is not only reflected

in the sharp drop in university enrollment rates due to the sudden drop in the birth rate but also

in the dramatic transformation of university education into vocational education. Universities

are  no  longer  the  halls  for  elaborating  academic  concepts  and  implementing  academic

development.  In addition to the fact that research-oriented universities regard the number of

teachers' publications in international journals as an indicator of research performance, this has

led to scholars competing to publish frivolous monographs jointly. There are even phenomena

of  citing  each  other's  papers  or  relying  on  their  elders  to  name  others  without  actually

participating in the research (eventually, the most serious case is Zhen-Yuan Chan's review and

falsification of 60 papers, 5 of which were named as co-authors by Minister of Education Wei-

Ning Jiang. After the incident, Minister Jiang was eventually forced to step down), becoming

an academic craftsman who focuses on technical  success  and does not  care about  the  grand

purpose  of  research.  Teaching-oriented  universities  regard  whether  students  can  obtain  jobs

after  graduation  as  a  teaching  performance  indicator  and  attach  great  importance  to  the

quantitative  results  of  industry-university  cooperation,  which  will  benefit  the  seamless

connection between academic and professional careers and increase the future employment rate

of graduates. The only consideration during the period. These two characteristics have caused

the "university spirit" that initially had a European classical meaning to decline significantly.

When higher  education  no longer  focuses on in-depth  research  and breadth  of teaching, the

apparent phenomenon is reflected in the fact that college students no longer have "knowledge"

of their self-identity. From the core definition, the meaning of "intellectual" is no longer like

the intellectuals in the past who would interpret and promote some forward-looking views, let

alone engage in larger-scale practices based on social concerns. They care about how to obtain

the easier "little luck" (しょうかっこう, a term from Harukami Muraki), but they are even

more  hesitant  about  finding  a  job.  College  students  face  a  "loss  of  ideal  focus"  in  life,

representing the most severe chapter in the development process of Taiwan's universities.

After college, students graduate, and even if they go to graduate school, they still need to

face employment problems. Career is a life issue that everyone needs to deal with throughout

101

their lives. The crux of the problem is that this is initially a life issue, but it is treated as a life

issue. Technical topics have been dealt with, causing universities to offer various vocational

training courses without paying attention to how to cultivate and develop the quality of human

life. When students do not know who they are, they feel at a loss about their own lives and are

just confused  all day.  In daily  life, no matter where people  are, they  are  busy swiping their

mobile phones, which makes every moment when people are in the scene feel like they are "not

there." When people become technical people who only know professional knowledge but have

no  life  literacy,  how  can  they  be  responsible  for  making  correct  career  choices  (or  even

academic choices) for their own lives? Or even how to prevent them from being indifferent to

society because they do not have rich life qualities and do not hesitate to use their professional

knowledge to do things that harm society? This is why universities should offer various life

education courses in general education. But what content and type of life education do college

students need? Life education itself has a cross-field nature. Suppose teachers only talk about

life education from their professional knowledge, especially if they teach it as an introduction

to philosophy or religion and only teach highly abstract philosophy or teachings. In that case,

this will inevitably be divorced from the "life world" that college students are facing, and it is

more challenging to attract college students' attention away from their mobile phones. Therefore,

it is quite an issue to understand the content and type of life education that college students need

and constructing an accurately corresponding "micro world" from it. It is worthy of discussion

and an indispensable link in the development of life education in Chinese society.

From this perspective, we need to go back and discuss the nature of life education. First,

let's clarify: Is the focus of life education courses on teachers, courses, textbooks, or students?

We will naturally point out that there are all four, but the key lies in the proportion. If the focus

is  on  teachers,  the  quality  of  teachers  will  significantly  affect  the  quality  of  life  education

courses. If teachers can achieve substantial physical and mental growth through preparing life

education courses, it is indeed a very positive thing regarding teacher empowerment. However,

if the most critical grower in this course is the teacher, it is difficult not to raise the following

doubts: How do students change during the learning process? If the focus is on the curriculum,

the life education curriculum does not need to overload the knowledge content of other existing

professional  fields,  causing  the  models  of  different  courses  to  transfer  to  this  course

unknowingly.  Instead,  it  should  respect  the  focus  of  its  education  and  pay  attention  to  the

specific and continuously changing "life," which means that course design cannot be too fixed

on the structural aspect and ignore the natural reactions of teachers and students in the course,

such as giving and receiving. If the focus is on teaching materials, then life education teaching

102

materials  should  be  designed  to  be  diverse  and  lively.  Still,  the  designer  of  any  teaching

materials  is  mainly  the  teacher.  Suppose  the  teacher  cannot  provide  appropriate  teaching

materials according to the student's situation. In that case, any exquisite teaching materials may

cause  the  problem  of  the  gap  between  teaching  and  learning  (for  example,  in  a  social

environment where students are accustomed to audio and video because they use a lot of mobile

phones, excessive playing of audio-visual programs as teaching materials by the teacher will

only lead to audio-visual burnout of students). In this case, students are the most critical targets

of life education courses. After all, the main subject of learning is students, although teachers,

courses,  and  teaching  materials  are  still  essential  links  that  cannot  be  ignored.  Moreover,

teachers should not  only teach students  a certain perspective of life  education just based on

teachers' professional fields (for example, teaching life lessons that should be multi-faceted into

a  single-faceted  philosophy  class,  although  it  is  impossible  not  to  include  philosophical

principles). Instead we should start from the specific life world in which students are exposed

to discuss the principles and methods of how students should "respond outwardly" and "deal

with themselves inwardly" in these ever-changing situations.

As long as there are principles and methods of "coping outward" and "dealing with oneself

inward," this involves issues of life ethics. Shouldn't it be traced back to the philosophical or

religious concepts that underpin various ethics? We cannot ignore this fact, but these contents

are only "intellectual facts." At the same time, there are "anti-intellectual facts," which we also

cannot ignore. We must pay close attention to the current "hidden" tension between teachers

and students in Taiwan's higher education. Most of the current university teachers have obtained

doctorates. There is no reason to suspect that these people do not belong to the true intellectual

elite, but as mentioned earlier, college students are no longer intellectuals. Knowledge no longer

has an ideal significance for college students but only has an instrumental significance, which

means  that  in  the  usual  education  and  cognition  of  college  students,  "Knowledge  points  to

employment"  and  "Employment  points  to  making  money."  When  acquiring  knowledge  no

longer equals exploring profound knowledge (meaning learning for the sake of learning), then

purely intellectual exploration is enough to arouse students' resentment, especially when this

matter is related to professional knowledge, is irrelevant, and cannot directly answer questions

such as employment and making money. However, this is the result of the increasing narrowing

of the vision of current college students. Suppose the deduction about this context is correct. In

that case, it will be difficult for current university teachers to teach abstract knowledge about

philosophy or religion in life education courses to arouse students' interest. Students learning

mentality  is  no  longer  about  knowledge  itself  but  unknowingly  slides  towards  the  goal  of

103

extremely  practical  interests  (this  is  true  for  learning  professional  knowledge  and  general

knowledge). This is why we must face up to the existing problems at the student level. This is

a vital "anti-intellectual fact" that must be addressed.

This  anti-intellectual  fact,  coupled  with  the  diversification  of  information  (learning

resources) absorption, especially the convenience of the Internet and its reading and listening

tools, has made students more accustomed to watching a large number of videos (especially

various entertaining videos). I no longer like "listening to the teacher's lectures," not to mention

whether the teacher's one-way lecture is suitable for teaching. The nature and content of lectures

should  have  considerable  knowledge-carrying  capacity,  but  if  the  information  is  not

internalized and thought through, it will not be effective. Equal to knowledge, when students

are  more  accustomed  to  "receiving  entertaining  information"  and  less  accustomed  to

"discussing  serious  knowledge,"  this  tendency  to  entertain  learning  makes  the  fact  of  anti-

knowledge more prominent in the classroom. The most common phenomenon is when teachers

are  subject  to  the  teaching  response  questionnaire  every  semester;  if  the  general  education

course unit does not impose any restrictions, the course content will become more kitsch (this

mainly refers to providing entertaining information) in exchange for " "Everyone is happy," this

embarrassing populist phenomenon is also an anti-knowledge fact, but because it is a newly

developed phenomenon, it has not yet been taken seriously by relevant teachers and researchers.

Students no longer have the self-identity of intellectuals, and teachers have unconsciously lost

their intellectual character. It is worth reflecting on this question: What is the common attribute

positioning of college students today? The author feels the term "proletariat" is more suitable

for understanding college students. If this term is interpreted from a capitalist perspective, it

should be interpreted as a "follower of popular culture"; if it is interpreted from a communist

perspective, to interpret it, it should be able to explain being a "proletarian laborer." From these

two perspectives, understanding the attributes and situations of current college students each

has profound meaning. Even if people work a lot, it is not easy to get a higher salary. If the

salary is not  high, problems such as employment and making money will be severe and  are

regarded by students as urgent matters. This phenomenon can be seen from the fact that college

students have been "working to earn a living" for a long time during their studies. At this time,

if university teachers continue to ignore the continuous gap in life and economic levels between

teachers and students, there is a huge knowledge gap, ignore the tension between each other's

knowledge,  and  are  indifferent  to  the  difficulties  faced  by  students,  and  still  teach  them

profound  knowledge,  and  was  angry  that  the  students  fell  asleep  in  class  caused  by  hard-

104

working  to  earn  a  living.  From  the  student's  perspective,  the  teacher  would  inevitably  give

people a sense of distance that "does not know the sufferings of the people's livelihood."

II. The Path from Abstract Thinking Back to Concrete Thinking

Based on the previous context, we can't help but find that current university teachers are

challenging. Suppose teachers are unwilling to  be vulgar and only talk  about  "self-enjoyed"

knowledge. In that case, it will likely give students a sense of distance from "not knowing the

sufferings of people's livelihood." If teachers are willing to be vulgar and play many videos to

entertain students, then university teachers will be willing to sink. Is there any "best of both

worlds" solution to this dilemma? The author feels that when we think about what kind of life

education college students need, university teachers need to have more profound empathy and

bend down to understand the specific needs of college students from a humble attitude rather

than  just  asking  students,  "Expand  your  horizons"  and  be  able  to  understand  the  profound

knowledge immediately. University teachers should not be arrogant about knowledge and make

students afraid of knowledge. When teachers are engaged in research work, they must continue

expanding their breadth and depth of knowledge. In developing new knowledge from existing

knowledge,  they  must  also  pay  attention  to  the  clarity  of  academic  concepts.  Still,  when

engaging  in  teaching  work,  they  should  temporarily  put  aside  their  personal  opinions.  The

preference  for  knowledge  should  no  longer  continue  to  talk  about  abstract  thinking  issues.

Instead, teaching should be guided by embedded thinking with  a broader scope of thinking.

After  all,  life  education  courses  should  differ  from  traditional  courses  focused  solely  on

acquiring  knowledge  and  information,  instead  promoting  character  education  for  the  whole

person’s development.  What is concrete thinking? Thinking may be distinguished into three

types: action, imagery, and abstract.

Action thinking is  the cornerstone of the evolution  and development  of  various human

thinking. The shaping of embodied thinking starts with action thinking. Action thinking uses

various actions and feelings to solve problems, and intuitive and specific actions accompany it.

For example, he will develop recognition and attachment to his mother's body and breath after

a baby is born. As long as the mother sees the baby's mouth sucking and crying, she will know

that he is hungry and needs to be fed. This is action thinking. Even in the adult stage, people

respond to various specific perceptions of the body, such as pain, temperature, touch, vision,

hearing, and taste... There is a specific external object as an object, and the medium is used to

105

trigger people's thinking. This is the primary stage of concrete thinking (Wei, 2009, pp. 18-

20)."

In the initial stage of embedded thinking, adults will operate quickly as their proficiency

increases, but as long as it is related to various feelings, it is only material embedded thinking;

when  embedded  thinking  no  longer  has  external  objects  as  objects,  it  often  When  the

imagination of the mind develops, spiritual embodied thinking will develop. Before discussing

spiritual embodied thinking, let us first discuss image thinking. Image thinking refers to specific

images or images as the content and type of people's thinking. This is also a kind of instinctive

thinking of people, and the tool of expression is often the image symbols of sensory experience.

Image thinking often has the advantage of being holistic, allowing thinking to quickly grasp

problems as a whole. It will not only reproduce existing images in thinking, but also process

existing images to produce new outputs (such as the presentation of various craft works), which

makes  the  advantage  of  image  thinking  lies  in  presenting  the  creativity  of  human  life,  and

civilization develops through this process (Wei, 2009, pp. 18-20). It can be seen from here that

the continued development of action thinking is image thinking. However, image thinking is

more spiritual than action thinking. Although it usually needs to use external objects as objects

to think, it is also a kind of material embodied thinking. When the image thinking understands

"getting the fish and forgetting the water", it means that the thinking reaches a certain level and

no longer relies on external objects as objects, and can purely develop the imagination of the

mind. This will then lead to the development of spiritual concrete thinking. Both action thinking

and image thinking belong to the content of embodied thinking. However, human thinking often

stays at the material stage, making these two kinds of thinking not as high as abstract thinking.

This is why Western culture in the past particularly focused on abstraction. The main cause of

thinking (conceptual thinking), from another perspective, is a major feature of the development

process  of  Western  culture  that  is  very  different  from  the  normal  appearance  of  human

civilization.

Abstract  thinking  is  a  process  in  which  people  use  concepts  to  reason  and  judge  in

cognitive activities to summarize objective reality indirectly. Viewed initially in the context of

Western culture, abstract thinking is a way to acquire knowledge. Only by turning the "subject-

object opposition" into the central axis of thinking through abstract thinking can foreign objects

be used as objects  to obtain a language structure and deepen understanding.  Of  course, this

concept can also be reversed. To put it bluntly, the awareness of the opposition between subject

and object enables the development of abstract thinking. However, the development of spiritual

thinking through embodied thinking mainly comes from the context of Chinese culture. The
most typical example is traditional Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine places great emphasis

106

on  experience.  Starting  from  the  legend  of  "Shen-Nong  tasted  a  hundred  herbs,"  Chinese

medical scientists and pharmacologists began to identify the properties of traditional Chinese

medicine  from  the  perspective  of  experience  and  measure  the  corresponding  relationship

between people and medicine, thus creating "The conclusion of the eight cardinal principles

syndrome differentiation (the eight cardinal principles refer to the four pairs of syndromes with

opposite  properties:  Yin  and  Yang,  cold  and  heat,  exterior  and  interior,  and  deficiency  and

excess), and have various rich feelings about the relationship between the internal organs and

meridians of the human body and the qi, blood, and body fluids, and developed pulse diagnosis,

a method of diagnosing illness through mutual experience between doctors and patients, is no

longer a simple action thinking, and it is not only an image thinking dominated by images. The

mind's  imagination,  detached  from  the  operation  and  judgment  of  the  object,  can  only  be

explained by  embodied thinking at  the spiritual  level.  Traditional Chinese medicine classics

such as "The Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic: A Theory of Yin and Yang's Corresponding

Symbols"  explain  that  "Corresponding  Symbols"  has  two  meanings:  "induction"  and

"correspondence."  Induction  is  subjective  experience,  while  correspondence  is  objective

reasoning. The former has the characteristics of the unity of subject and object, while the latter

has  the  characteristics  of  subject  and  object  opposition.  However,  embodied  thinking  itself

cannot exclude abstract thinking. It still means using concepts for reasoning and judging. Still,

embodied thinking has a detailed development context at the induction level, which makes it

have independent characteristics different from abstract thinking (Wei, 2009, pp. 18-20). Please

see Figure 1 for the evolution process of Chinese and Western thinking styles:

Understanding that Chinese culture originally had the characteristics of concrete thinking,

what is the significance of returning to engage in university life education teaching? The author

feels  teachers  should  no  longer  just  engage  in  "curriculum-based  learning"  based  on  their

abstract knowledge. Teachers need to sense and respond to the students they face precisely,

experience  each  other's  most  authentic  physical  and  mental  states,  and  provide  accurate

guidance  in  a  timely  manner.  In  response,  life  education  should  be  developed  from  the

discussion  process,  meaning  "dialogue"  should  be  essential  in  curriculum  development,

allowing each other's true thoughts to be revealed in the dialogue. Whitney Griswold, former

president of Yale University, defined dialogue this way: "The remarkable creative art by which

humans interpret their feelings, turn them into rationale, and then share these with their peers.

The deep inner thoughts and concepts on which it is built." (Zakarid, 2015/2016, p. 56) The

author  feels  that  this  statement  shows  that  he  believes  dialogue  has  concrete  thinking

characteristics. Teachers must admit that they are facing lively and real "life" "no longer just

facing inanimate foreign objects as objects; both the subject and the object will have various

changes in physical and mental reactions. Teachers need to be sincere and prescribe a "medicine

list"  like  the  "pulse  diagnosis"  of  traditional  Chinese  medicine,  giving  the  most  beneficial

"Therapy" for students. Since students have not reported any problems of their own, teachers

have  no  way  of  knowing  the  students'  specific  situations.  Therefore,  teachers  can  adopt

"problem-based  learning"  (PBL),  using  vaguely  structured  questions  as  learning  situations,

allowing students to act as the stakeholders of the problem, actively apply learning to integrate

old and new knowledge, collaboratively discuss, raise questions, and find answers to jointly

structure the content of the course (Yang, 2012, pp. 2-12). This process is about "losing the

structure of knowledge" and "reconstructing knowledge," but this is only the first level. Then,

the  teacher  uses  the  answers  provided  by  the  students  to  measure  the  student's  current

knowledge level and gives some rhetorical questions on time. To trigger students to continue

thinking or to deliberately create a suspenseful situation based on the answer to activate students

to continue asking questions, both can significantly arouse students' learning motivation. These

are all concrete practices of dialogue.

Next, the author also wants to explain "action learning." The action learning method is a

significant adjustment to traditional classroom teaching. When the learning object is no longer

just textbooks but specific "people, things, time, place, and cause," it is called 5W in English

(who, what, when, where, why) essentials, teaching students to face specific problems directly

108

in the process of practice by mastering relevant knowledge, thereby clarifying the essence and

extended  phenomena  of  the  problem.  Based  on  the  author's  actual  teaching  experience  of

implementing action learning methods in life education courses, students  are taught to draw

mind maps along the lines of thought. Then, students are allowed to draw crayons on the lesson

plan paper to draw mind maps about "Who am I?" students develop a perceptual understanding

of  themselves  through  drawing  pictures,  thereby  reflecting  on  their  specific  problems.

Extending from knowing yourself, teachers can start interactive exercises such as "Can I believe

you: blind eyes and not blind hearts?" Ask students to cover their eyes with a white towel in the

first class and put their hands on each other. Holding the shoulders of the person in front, the

group leader will lead everyone to walk around the classroom floor. Finally, the whole group

will  return  to  the  classroom  to  cultivate  the  group  members'  trust  in  the  group  leader;  after

returning, everyone in the class will choose one from each other. Two partners work in pairs,

and each person takes turns covering his eyes with a white towel; one person leads him to walk

on campus for about 20 minutes, and then the experience is exchanged. After returning to the

classroom,  everyone  used  crayons  to  draw  the  "mental  image"  of  "blind  eyes  but  not  blind

heart" on the lesson plan paper, which means the picture that comes to mind when you are being

led  or  leading  others.  We  can  see  from  the  teaching  response  evaluation  that  this  kind  of

situational practice can cultivate students' team-building and life experience. But this is just a

starting point. For more practical action learning, for example, the teacher designs the lesson

plan "Discovering the Garbage Mileage in the Corner of the Campus" and tells the students to

start a group "Wandering Bird Trip," leading the students to the campus to discover the campus

in the first class. The garbage mileage in the corner is used to complete action learning. The

specific  method  is  that  the  teacher  asks  members  of  each  group  to  prepare  garbage  bags  in

advance and bring used disposable bamboo chopsticks or used plastic gloves. Everyone looks

for them on  campus together. Observe where there is  "unknown"  garbage, and then ask the

students  to  look  at this puzzling garbage and discuss the age of this garbage, including five

questions: (1) Who made it? (2) Where does it originally exist? (3) Is it beneficial to the human

body?  (4)  Who  bought  and  discarded  it?  (5)  What  is  the  most  suitable  destination  for  it?

Everyone brainstormed together to confirm the final mileage of the garbage, and then they used

the tools they had prepared to pick up the garbage and put it into garbage bags. There is no limit

to the type or amount of waste collected by each group, and the focus is on the quality of the

entire discussion and practice. The teacher will ask students to return to the classroom before

the  bell  rings  for  the  second  class.  After  a  5-minute  discussion,  each  group  will  report  the

"findings." Finally, students will be asked to complete the final destination of the garbage and

109

discard it to the most suitable resource. In the recycling bin, after experiencing this fantastic

journey"  of  "garbage  turning  into  "gold,"  students  are  asked  to  draw  crayons  on  this

unforgettable journey. Students often say that they have never used this perspective to observe

the campus they are in every day.

Finally, the author will discuss the significance of "service learning" to life education. This

learning method, while not limited to general education, is particularly suitable for teaching life

education  courses.  It  emphasizes  the  combination  of  "service"  and  "learning"  and  obtains

learning  benefits  in  the  service  process.  In  this  type  of  education,  students  participate  in

carefully planned social services and structured design, apply the knowledge and skills learned

in  school,  and  combine  the  needs  of  the  people  in  the  community,  learning  reflection  and

reciprocity, thereby improving learning effectiveness. Reflection refers to students' analyzing

problems encountered during service. Reciprocity means that students no longer only regard

the person being served as the object of help but also reflect and grow from it as a source of

education, and bring about changes and progress at all three ends, including students, schools,

and communities (Jacoby & Associates, 1996, pp. 5-7). Service learning is a kind of experiential

learning that can mainly be conducted in society. It can be understood from the social learning

theory advocated by Albert Bandura (1925-). He believed that human learning is a relationship

between  individuals  and  the  process  of  continuous  social  interaction.  Most  of  the  human

behavior comes from learning. From birth, individuals learn the behavior of others all the time

or even unconsciously.

As they grow older, their actions, thoughts, feelings, and views on things finally become

a person that is accepted by their family and society (Ren & Chen, 2004). Therefore, exposing

students to various natural features of society can lead to profound experiences for students.

For example, when the author led students to the National Yilan Special Education School to

engage in service learning, students were asked to help with gardening, such as cutting flowers

and inserting them into children's pots. ; Or help push a paralyzed child in a wheelchair around

campus and bask in the sun; or paint and create handmade books with children; or help children

clean cars; or make and sell drinks with children; or assist children in computer word processing;

or lead Students participated in inter-school tug-of-war competitions and blind baseball games

held  by  the  school...  By  serving  these  children  with  particular  disabilities,  college  students

learned from feedback sheets that they generally have a more profound experience of life and

learn human skills from these children. How difficult it is to be alive, and recalling the hardships

that parents put into giving birth to themselves, people should cherish life more. This is more

110

direct to people's hearts than abstract concepts about Confucianism. Experiential learning does

have its benefits.

Mainland  China  scholar  Professor  Kang  Ouyang  once  discussed  the  long-term

"educational dislocation" in school education. The teacher was eager to teach elementary school

classes  when  a  student  was  in  kindergarten.  When  a  student  was  in  elementary  school,  the

teacher  was  keen  to  teach  middle  school  classes;  when  a  student  was  in  middle  school,  the

teacher was eager to teach university classes; and when a student was in college, the teacher

found that students had to go back to learn  abilities what kindergarten classes should teach.

That is, the college teacher wanted college students to learn how to speak, behave, and be polite

and civilized. However, since the behavioral norms of college students have long been formed,

it isn't  easy  to  carry out  essential quality education now. (Ouyang, 2015, pp. 92-94).  Is this

phenomenon  not  the  case  in  Taiwan?  Life  education  indeed  needs  to  be  planned  and

implemented step by  step from  preschool to  university. However, suppose we feel  that it is

difficult to carry out life education that directly addresses the specific problems of students in

higher education and hesitate to move forward. In that case, this is also not the face of education

for university teachers. Attitude that should be maintained. Professor Ouyang Kang believes

that real-life education should  be self-education,  guiding college students to  transform  from

passive  educators  to  active  self-educators  so  that  they  know  how  to  question  themselves

constantly, and teachers should change from lecture-type teachers to coaching-type teachers.

Teachers no longer indulge in self-expression and self-appreciation in monologues but must

work  together  with  students,  allowing  students  to  perform  life  through  class  and  realize  the

progress of life. He feels that this kind of coaching-type teacher must respond to the survival

issues students raise and interpret the difficulties and confusions they face in their life course

(Ouyang, 2015, pp. 92-94). The author feels that using activities instead of lectures to teach and

allowing students to learn in situations designed by teachers will help teachers accurately play

the role of coaches and make students feel that learning is enjoyable.

III. Teachers' Teaching Attitude in Anti-intellectual Fact

As  mentioned  earlier,  the  most  typical  manifestation  of  concrete  thinking  comes  from

Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine emphasizes experience, so its medical knowledge is not

abstract  knowledge  independent  of  people  but  experiential  knowledge  internal  to  people.

Experiential knowledge is implicit knowledge that pays attention to personal feelings. It is often

obtained  through  learning  or  repeated  practice,  such  as  the  experience  of  learning  to  ride  a

111

bicycle  or  swim.  People  concretize  the  cognition  they  feel,  thus  brewing  the  process  and

phenomenon  of  "knowledge."  unknowingly,  this  "knowledge"  has  become  an  individual's

implicit  thoughts  or  skills,  which  is  different  from  explicit  knowledge  (meaning  abstract

knowledge) that accumulates experience but detaches it from experience and uses language to

conceptualize knowledge. The process of expertise naturally has an object that makes people

feel various symptoms of its existence. Experience comes from things that are compatible and

integrated  between  people,  meaning  an  existence  is  constantly  flowing  and  cannot  be  seen.

Traditional  Chinese  Thoughts  are  called  "Qi".  Let's  look  at  concrete  thinking  from  the

perspective of psychophysiology. It is the energy circuit in which the human nervous system

sends external information to the center of consciousness, linking psychology and physiology

to  transform  energy  (Yasa  Yasuo,  2009,  pp.  63-99).  Therefore,  concrete  thinking  is  both

material and spiritual. Its accumulation and onset, and the use of language to explain people's

inner experience, will brew into empirical knowledge. There is another practical example.

When a person develops a "sense of Qi" during Qigong practice, this is not an abstraction

of his perception into a concept but comes from experience. When a practitioner realizes that

"the  intention  is  to  guard  the  Dantian,"  this  does  not  require  people  to  focus  on  the  word

"Dantian." "Dantian" is initially just a Chinese medicine symbol one and a half inches below

the navel. The intention of guarding the Dantian is not to ask people to recognize the symbol

but  to  place  the  mind  on  the  Dantian  area  itself,  which  makes  the  practice  of  minding  the

Dantian no longer abstract thinking. It is not image thinking caused by recalling specific images

or  action  thinking  caused  by  any  particular  behavior  because  it  uses  thoughts  to  induce  the

Dantian.  The  feeling  in  this  part  of  the  body  will  produce  a  warm  feeling,  intensifying  the

person's natural sense of the Dantian. Psychology affects physiology, and physiology affects

psychology. In this interactive cycle, the consciousness is concrete thinking (Wei, 2009, pp. 18-

20).

Although we currently do not have large-scale empirical evidence, it is not difficult to find

from teaching experience that students have "anti-intellectual fact" and "anti-social personality"

are highly positively correlated, according to Martha Smith of Harvard Medical School in the

United  States.  Dr.  Martha  Stout's  research  found  that  the  environmental  factors  that  affect

antisocial personality  are related to  cultural  characteristics. Moreover, previous studies  have

pointed out  that antisocial  personality is quite rare in  East  Asian societies (including Japan,

Mainland China, and Taiwan). Antisocial personality exists in Taiwan. The rate is far lower

than the average of 4% in Western countries. For example, in the United States, the prevalence

rate of antisocial personality has continued to rise significantly. This is highly related to North

112

American culture, which regards individualism as a core value. The United States places the

individual as the central axis of thinking.

The tendency to develop an antisocial personality is much higher than that of East Asian

societies  that  emphasize  gregariousness.  This  is  mainly  because  East  Asian  culture  has  an

overwhelming belief system, which allows antisocial personality people with emotional defects

to make up for it at the cognitive level. Compared with Western culture, A culture of personal

control  that places extreme emphasis  on individualism.  East  Asian culture has  a theological

view of the interdependence of all things in the universe. Its conscience serves as the basis of

human cognition,  allowing  everyone to  have a deep sense of  connection with  others (Stout,

2006/2007, pp. 196 -201). Calling this type of interdependence of all things in the universe a

"theological view" will inevitably lead to misunderstandings (the interdependence of all things

does not necessarily come from the concept of a personal God). However, it cannot be denied

that East Asian culture does pay more attention to human beings. The harmony between my

relationship and the relationship between heaven and man, thereby internalizing and expanding

the pattern and vision of "I," is different from the attitude of individualism. This attitude's core

value  is  more  suitable  for  "relationalism."  East  Asian  countries’  mutually  respected

Confucianism is the primary connotation that breeds and influences this core value (Hwang,

2009). I and others have a close relationship, and I and nature also have a close relationship.

However, the author has to seriously point out that this kind of cultural belief rooted in tradition

is no longer easily accepted by university teachers who have studied in Western countries and

highly rely on the abstract knowledge teaching system; moreover, due to the uprooting project

of Chinese culture in Taiwan since the education reform in 1995, this kind of cultural belief

rooted in tradition has disappeared without a trace in the life world of the younger generation

of college students. This has naturally developed amorality and apathy. The various phenomena

of guilt have greatly expanded the social problems caused by antisocial personalities in East

Asian countries, including Taiwan.

To deal with this problem, if teachers only return to various traditional moral dogmas to

argue in an attempt to save the world that teachers think has fallen into ruin, I am afraid it will

only  trigger  a  strong  backlash  from  students,  and  it  is  also  inconsistent  with  the  academic

tendency of universities that always attach importance to " Knowledge education" rather than

"moral education" is obviously different. The most fundamental question is how the Chinese

society can achieve a harmonious blend of Chinese and Western cultures and create new life

from tradition. More specifically, how can the corresponding "microworld" be extracted from

the  "life  world"  of  the  Chinese  society  through  dialogue  and  structured  indigenous  social

113

sciences are used to interpret our own traditions and the problems we are facing. This is initially

a  specific  issue  that  universities  in  Chinese  society  should  prioritize  facing  and  solving.  It

benefits college students by implementing higher education, but it is an unfulfilled conceptual

dilemma. Suppose we continue to ignore this fundamental issue. In that case, it will be difficult

not to trigger the story of falsehood in higher education and repeat the chaos of "only teaching,

not educating." Teachers may now face college students with strong "general mass" tendencies.

A strong sense of helplessness often occurs when teachers discuss their great principles while

students  are  invisible  and  wallowing  in  their  virtual  corners.  Continuing  from  the  three

innovative teaching methods mentioned above, the author wants to clarify how these contents

contain  and  activate  students'  concrete  thinking.  Suppose  the  concept  of  "qi  sensation

generation  experience"  is  used  to  explain  the  teaching  level  of  life  education  from  the

perspective of the problem-based learning method when the teacher raises vaguely structured

questions as a learning situation. In that case, the question is not the focus, and the teacher does

not  want  students  to  focus  on  it.  Thinking  about  the  problem  only  makes  students  feel  the

problem we are facing (generating a sense of the problem). By cultivating an understanding of

the problem (making students feel the authenticity of the problem), the sense of agitation will

further  strengthen  students'  ability  to  solve  problems.  In  this  way,  students  will  continue  to

dialogue  with  their  drifting  thoughts  and  feel  that  these  thoughts  are  projected  into  external

operations and practices. Through discussions among peers to stimulate thinking, students can

have the confidence and ability to solve problems.

From  the  perspective  of  action  learning  and  service  learning  methods,  when  students

master knowledge through  action learning or service learning, the practice will  give them a

sense of specific knowledge. At this time, they can gain an understanding of the problem by

starting  to  discuss  the  problem.  In  reality,  the  interactive  experience  between  the  two  can

promote the expansion of learning horizons, which is a deeper interpretation of the connotation

of  dialogue.  The  author  feels  that  behind  these  teaching  methods  generated  by  embodied

thinking,  the  teaching  attitude  teachers  hold  towards  students  should  focus  on  how  to  help

students open their spiritual awakening. Therefore, it may be better to call it a "mind-learning

attitude"  to  reflect  its  deeper  meaning  better.  The  background  is  as  follows:  From  the

perspective  of  Chinese  intellectual  history,  during  the  development  of  Confucianism  in  the

Song and Ming dynasties, the two ideological lines of "ideaology" and "nousology" have long

been in conflict and integration. If we take " Chapter 27 of "The Doctrine of the Mean" says:

"Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and

study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, to omit none of the more exquisite

114

and  minute  points  which  it  embraces,  and  to  raise  it  to  its  greatest  height  and  brilliance,  to

pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge and is continually acquiring

new knowledge. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all

propriety."  (Xie, 1988, p. 53). Current  relevant  research often points out  that "ideaology"  is

more inclined to the knowledge line of "learn from knowledge" and nouslogy is more inclined

to the cultivation line of "respect for virtue." However, both Learnings encompasses two routes

at the same time. The earliest study of mind can be traced back to Mencius's advocacy of "good

nature." Cheng Hao in the Northern Song Dynasty started it, and Lu Jiuyuan in the Southern

Song Dynasty opened up its path, competing with Zhu Xi, the great master of ideaology at the

same time. By the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Wang Yangming, who was deeply influenced

by Zhu Xi and finally emerged from the cocoon, first proposed the word "nouslogy," which

made  nouslogy  begin  to  have  an  independent  academic  context  (Chen,  2012,  pp.  27-54).

Compared  with  ideaology,  which  attaches  great  importance  to  intellectual  speculation,

nouslogy  inherits  its  lineage,  but  pays  more  attention  to  the  awakening  of  the  soul  itself

(opening up conscience), which means focusing on the experience of life, and adopts a "go in,

come  out"  style  of  knowledge.  Wang,  The  wide  spread  of  Yangming's  nouslogy,  is  closely

related to  the fact  that his  thoughts  can be simple and clear and directly  pointed to  people's

hearts, making people willing to change their "attitude towards life" and "thinking about life."

His  lectures  (including  the  type  and  content  of  lectures)  are  engaged  in  the  work  of  life

education (Chen, 2012, pp. 27-54) so that people from all walks of life in the three religions

and nine classes of society can learn as long as they are willing. During the Ming Dynasty,

Confucian political concepts developed along the popular line of "get the king to practice the

Tao" to "awaken the people to practice the Tao" (Yu, 2004, pp. 297-332). Thinking from the

perspective  of  the  needs  of  the  current  social  environment,  unlike  the  academic  lineage  of

ideaology, which has been cut off, nouslogy has been popular for more than 150 years since the

middle and late Ming Dynasty. The late Qing Dynasty, the early Republic of China, and the

Meiji  Restoration  in  Japan  once  profoundly  influenced  Japan.  The  prosperity  and  strength

provided  key  ideological  momentum.  They  impacted  the  revolutionary  Sun  Yat-sen's  "The

theory that it is more difficult to know than to act" in the late Qing Dynasty and the reformist

Liang Qichao's "New Citizen theory." Unfortunately, the Chinese themselves were politically

Due  to  the  long-term  failure  to  realize  the  style  that  civil  society  should  have,  democratic

politics  has  turned  into  populist  politics.  Suppose  we  hope  to  improve  the  civic  literacy  of

college students in higher education and benefit the development of a more mature civil society.

In that case, we can learn from this direct and simple psychological style in teaching or better

115

educate college students with "proletariat" attributes. It can be beneficial. The development of

the two Confucian cultural lines of "learn from knowledge" and "respect for virtue" is shown

in Figure 2:

Figure 2
Development Map of Two Confucian Cultural Routes

Adopting a free style of "going in and coming out" of knowledge and no longer clinging

to superficial words, this is why Lu Jiuyuan would question Zhu Xi: "What books can be read

before Yao and Shun?" (1980, page 491) This implies Yao and Shun. The two kings did not

become saints by reading. Of course, the saints before Yao and Shun had no books to read, and

the  saints  after  Yao  and  Shun  did  not  necessarily  only  read.  This  does  not  mean  reading  is

wrong, but the focus is not on reading so Lu Jiuyuan can teach people. "Inventing the original

mind," Wang Yangming also said: "Only this conscience is sufficient." (1992, page 1279) The

critical point is that if people trust their Conscience, they can achieve the purpose of education,

and  the  understanding  of  Conscience  is  the  first  meaning  of  education  because  this  is  the

ultimate source of the "life world" in human beings. Just as Wang Yangming said: "Conscience

is  the  spirit  of  creation.  These  spirits  are  born  in  heaven  and  earth  and  become  ghosts  and

emperors;  they  all  come  out  of  this.  They  are  incompatible  with  things.  If  people  are

reincarnated, they are perfect, without any shortcomings, and dances with joy without knowing

what kind of joy there is in the world." ("Instructions for Practical Living" Volume 2, Article

61, Wang, 1997, page 139) Lu and Wang The two nouslogists did not turn their backs on the

book. Still, nouslogists would adopt an anti-knowledge attitude to face knowledge (for example,

after  Wang  Yangming  first  realized  Taoism  in  Longchang,  he  then  memorized  the  "Five

Classics"  verbal  verification,  which  was  all  consistent),  and  vice  versa.  Let  knowledge  be

deconstructed  and  expanded.  This  attitude  is  very  suitable  for  facing  the  current  learning

difficulties of college students. The study of mind is like anti-knowledge, which does not mean

to be against ideaology, but to absorb its essential connotation. It does not mean that there is no
knowledge  at  all,  but  the  source  of  its  knowledge  is  no  longer  abstract  knowledge  but

116

experiential knowledge. When college students have reality of anti-knowledge, if they feel tired

of knowledge learning, they would rather hide on their mobile phones to play with messages in

every class than listen to the teacher's lectures, especially if you lack the motivation to study in

areas that cannot directly respond to professionalism and making money. Teachers will now

offer  life  education  courses  through  problem-based  methods,  action  learning  methods,  and

service learning methods. Students can experience life through personal practice, and it is easier

to open up their consciences. The author proposes the concept of "multiple teaching paradigms"

here, which means that although this article suggests three teaching methods, it does not mean

that only these three methods can present teachers' mental attitudes and students' experiential

learning, any teaching conducted from a student-centered perspective can help students grasp

their Conscience (restore their Conscience) and help college students have a sense of learning.

These  are  teaching  methods  worth  developing  in  the  field  of  life  education  (although  these

teaching methods are not only applicable to Life education, or it can be said that these teaching

methods can help students understand life even if they are applied to  professional academic

fields), and can be called a practice of concrete thinking.

Moreover, suppose there is no spiritual awakening to develop empirical knowledge and

only the indoctrination of abstract knowledge without internalization in life. How can we ensure

that students will not commit various high-intelligence crimes? Teachers should give up the

arrogance of knowledge, no longer look down on students as the owners of knowledge, and use

the  knowledge  spectrum  to  talk  to  students.  This  will  only  create  an  invisible  gap  between

teachers and students. Only by taking the initiative to step out and pay attention to students, let

life and Meeting life, genuinely listening to the problems that happen to students, and building

a harmonious teacher-student relationship like the ancient academy. This is also a mind-study

attitude, which can make people look back and reflect on the Chinese cultural relationship that

emphasizes the world of life. The significance of university life education. For information on

how multiple teaching models can help college students ""restore their conscience,"" please see

Multiple Teaching Models to Restore Conscience

The academy system gradually developed some kind of special spiritual school from the

Song Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty. Although private schools did not originate from academies,

in the "late Spring and Autumn Period," Confucius ran a school in Qufu, State of Lu, which

disseminated knowledge from the royal officials to all classes. The historical significance of

the ordinary people (commoners, savages, and even enslaved people), throughout the "Warring

States  Period,"  hundreds  of  different  schools  of  thought  coexisted,  that  is,  through  thinkers

giving lectures in various countries, a considerable number of people from all walks of life were

produced, and these thinkers each held their own opinions Striving for the energy to influence

politics, combining theory and practice to create history. However, thinkers often lectured in

secluded mountains and forests in later academies. Some people faced specific confusions and

difficulties,  hoping  to  find  answers,  and  traveled  thousands  of  miles  to  find  out.  Under  the

guidance of teachers, students study together daily and are intertwined through weal and woe.

If given the opportunity, they will engage in governance and serve the people; if not, they will

focus on self-cultivation and enjoy traveling. Regardless of whether they are officials or not,

they are all striving for the aspirations of the saints. The most significant difference between

academies and private schools in the past is their development of a mature learning system over

time (such as the lectures in the Song Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty) through the four levels

of "heaven, people, things, and self." Cultivation of the personality of teachers and students

gives people the opportunity to calmly explore and face various relationships and learn how to

live a wise life that is more lively and freely. Understanding the significance of academies also

means understanding how Chinese culture has experienced internal transformation and external

dissemination by thinkers.

Through the positive educational impact of academies on society, the current society needs

to reflect on the role of people's spiritual awakening in improving citizens' overall quality of

life. The value of education, such as the lack of an educational model like a college that inspires

teachers  and  students  to  explore  inner  together,  obviously  continues  to  impart  technical

knowledge to higher education for many years without discussing the specific life difficulties

faced by people themselves, which will eventually breed serious consequences. Question. In

the middle and late Ming Dynasty, nouslogy was actively spread by scholars who succeeded

Wang Yangming (especially the "Taizhou School" started by Wang Xinzhai), which greatly

influenced the people. All walks of life were affected by the nouslogy to varying degrees, and

Confucianism was thoroughly exerted in society. On the ground floor, it can be seen that the

free and easy life style of nouslogists has contagious solid energy, which makes all illiterate

118

traders and servants, including woodcutters and potters, consciously and deeply inspired (Chan,

2005, pp. 110-113). From this perspective, we can reflect on the present and the past.

Although  the  current  environment  of  higher  education  is  full  of  crises,  how  can  we

university teachers "cry each other in a new pavilion," lamenting to each other that the time is

not given to us, the quality of college students is not high, and the teachers can only continue

to play the piano to others? Zhu Daosheng's words can make stubborn people nod their heads.

We should reflect on ourselves: College students who have been insensible to the explosion of

knowledge and information will feel their souls deeply shocked again because they meet our

aspiring teachers. If college students are interested in learning, Knowledge is repulsive. If the

mountain doesn't come to me, I will go to the mountain. Can't we follow the trend that college

students are accustomed to, adopt anti-knowledge methods, strengthen their experience level,

and lead these young people to see their conscience? Knowledge-carrying capacity is an issue

that university teachers themselves prepare for lessons. It only needs to be answered in teaching

research  discussions  among  teachers.  However,  in  the  teaching  environment,  make  students

willing to participate in the content you prepare and enjoy this learning feast, feel one's gains

and growth; this is the teacher's teaching achievement. The teacher's personal teaching attitude

will  affect  the  teaching  effectiveness  of  the  whole  class.  Therefore,  cultivating  a  positive

attitude  and  adopting  flexible  teaching  methods  from  concrete  thinking  can  attract  students'

attention and help students light up their souls. This is what teachers have set up: The mission

that life education courses should shoulder.

從榮格取向表達性藝術治療論一位本土重鬱症女性離苦得樂之經驗

李蓉蓉*    黃宗堅    張芳庭

摘要

研究目的：為了解一位深受本土文化影響之重度憂鬱症困擾的女性，在榮格取向表

達性藝術治療介入後之轉化經驗。研究方法：採用主題分析法質性研究，進行榮格取向

之表達性藝術治療，共有 12 次個別治療及 1 次親子會談，另外並有轉介單位紀錄、家

庭會談紀錄及簡式健康量表進行檢驗。研究結果：得知個案童年遭受父母婚姻及家(cid:13687)壓

力所造成的陰影，以至於成年後無法達到家(cid:13687)期待或自我要求之成就回饋父母時，則落

入自我懷疑存在的意義及價值，更由於承受來自家(cid:13687)中光宗耀祖或是盡孝道的壓力而有

痛不欲生的想法，個案罹患重鬱症與家庭關係中愛與要求間矛盾衝突的情感，並持續影

響著自我發展與親子關係。經過治療介入，在沙盤治療中看見兩極對立與渴望被了解的

需求；在超越功能上可以體會個案所承受被吞噬且憂鬱的情緒，體驗走向共融的可能；

在夢的解析上看見個案面對問題能夠出現彈性及鬆動固著無望的念頭及協助個案辨識

家庭文化影響；在童話解析中個案選擇的童話都投射了對家人濃厚的情感，尤其在最後

一片葉子的故事中，更顯露出個案內心狀態歷經死亡後重生的議題。而後期親子會談中

更是父女關係冰釋，建立深化關係的神聖時刻。可以彙整出權力／控制、離別與哀傷、

分化與連結、安全感與自由以及滋養與撫育等五個主題。個案簡式健康量表前後測也達

顯著的差異。研究結論：顯示榮格取向表達性藝術治療對於重鬱症個案之療效，提供個

案在困境中一個涵容的空間，使得個案有機會能面對內在陰影以及兩極對立，並產生存

在感及意義感，頗有死後重生的意境。在現實生活中個案也學習重新找尋新的人生目標，

更期待自己可以至海外體驗人生。在諮商歷程中也可以感受到個案所承受本土文化之影

響以及家庭文化在凝聚家人情感上所扮演的角色壓力，貼近個案的憂鬱情緒及壓力來源，

個案學習在過與不及的愛中取得平衡，適當的安排加入親子溝通會談的機會，如此之方

式更有助於個案及案家多重的改變。

關鍵詞：榮格取向、表達性藝術治療、重鬱症、本土文化

        本研究從本土化心理學觀點探討及了解一位個案的童年因著父母關係不睦所致而

產生的創傷生活經驗之現象，並且罹患重鬱症，透過個案的描述，可以體察個案在傳統

本土文化色彩家庭中成長，Nasir 等（2021）之研究中亦提及憂鬱症的治療模式必須了解

文化、個人身分及對幸福感等概念。此外，治療方法亦需要將社會和情感概念結合起來。

Jung（1964/2013）所提及的集體潛意識如同文化象徵用以表達永恆真理，經過長期的轉

變成為文明社會所接受的集體形象，由本研究也可以看見集體潛意識對個案的影響甚鉅。

再加上個案在父母離異後，產生極大心理影響，對於個案在成年後仍持續承受來自家庭

文化壓力及重新生活的過程，研究者試圖使用榮格取向表達性藝術治療介入之個案轉化

經驗的探討，看見個案的接受度佳，並且也願意藉由此方法對於自身的潛意識更深入的

探索。Mehl-Madrona 和 Mainguy（2021）也提及文化因受集體主義的心態影響，群體的

需求取代個人的需求，因此治療方法需要考量當地文化和靈性。

研究者進行相關文獻的探討，了解夫妻離異的適應需要從歷程觀點來思考，壓力、

風險及復原力都需含括其中，對成人和孩子而言都是很大的壓力（Irene et al., 2017/2019）。

衛生福利部調查及統計分析我國於民國 104 年底 15-64 歲婦女處於離婚狀態者較民國

100 年（前次）調查增逾 2 成（衛生福利部，2015）。單親父（母）因應目前生活之態

度，以「努力工作維持家計」及「專心照顧子女」為主；對成為單親後的感受認為「工

作或經濟壓力較大」、「擔心自己或子女未來」及「與子女感情更好」，顯見單親家庭

後經濟問題與子女相處問題成為單親父（母）的生活重心。成為單親家庭後子女在心理

健康方面有負面影響者占 38.29%，子女性格行為方面者占 28.25%（衛生福利部，2010）。

由此的確可以看到家庭的崩解對於個體在成長過程中的影響，因此本研究使用榮格取向

表達性藝術治療方式介入個案處遇工作，試圖了解及幫助在單親家庭中離異之父母關係

不良情形下對於個體影響，以至於成年後情緒行為的變化，其目的不啻是促進國人對於

本土單親家庭成長之成人所承受之文化、社會等重新適應之社會心理壓力之了解，而個

案個體化的歷程更是讓人感佩的學習經驗。

一、從本土心理學探討個案憂鬱

首先，我們先理解何謂本土心理學？依據楊國樞（2005）定義如下：本土心理學是

一種以科學方法研究某一特定(cid:13687)群團體或社會文化中之人民的心理與行為發展所出來

的心理學知識體系，但研究歷程中所採用的理論、概念、方法及工具必須與所探討的本

土心理或行為現象及其生態的、經濟的、社會的、文化的及歷史的脈絡高度契合、符合

或貼合。

從楊國樞（2005）定義本土心理學不難理解是一種，可用來了解當地人之心理與行

為的方法，從此脈絡來看個案的議題可以說是更貼近個案的身處的環境。而楊國樞（1993）

123

提及中國人的社會取向性格的特徵包括：家(cid:13687)取向、關係取向、權威取向及他人取向四

種，其中又以家(cid:13687)取向象徵權威至上，重視家(cid:13687)和諧、團結、富足與榮譽，並且權威敏

感與關係取向密不可分。另外張德勝（1989）提到儒學倫理的終極目標就是「和」的概

念以及黃光國（1995）從中國儒家思想建構出「人情與面子的理論模式」，一方面鞏固

自己的權威地位，一方面強調榮宗耀祖。許詩淇和葉光輝（2019）更說明了華人社會的

文化基調是集體與關係主義，特別重視群體與關係的特性對華人之心理與行為有深遠的

影響。葉光輝等（2006）認為家庭文化（family culture），指的是由家(cid:13687)承傳下來，為成

員間共享（關係結構）的一些價值觀信念及規範。另外重視向心性或一體感及劃分內外

界線等。在溝通互動模式包括有：交換訊息、不善表達情感等。從文獻中可以看到，華

人的價值信念也可能產生(cid:13687)群間的牽制作用。

個案出生在 21 世紀，與其父母及祖父母的觀念呈現世代間的差距，再加上個案從

小學習外文，讀書更是以外文系的環境為主，所以在個案本身也出現了嚴重被西化後的

情形，從文獻及個案的背景資料中可以看見個案身處在華人家庭中，身為單親家庭中的

獨生女角色，家(cid:13687)中、關係裡對於個案之影響，在個案與其家(cid:13687)之間密切接觸的程度來

看，不難理解個案的情緒、觀念、性格養成與家(cid:13687)有著無法切割的關係，在無手足能夠

分擔或是分享這樣的壓力情境下，所引發重鬱症的身心症狀，更讓個案在這無助的情境

下深深覺得「死」或許是面對難題的一種解脫。

而中國文化中也可見父權制度下當權者的權利，的確是提供個案安全感的來源，但

是也是重面子，講求以和為貴之責任與壓力的源頭，個案在自己與家(cid:13687)間重要性的拿捏

該如何取得平衡，這是一門很不容易的課題。就如同榮格取向的煉金爐所強調的，就像

是個人與(cid:13687)群間的融合、中西方的融合，這些都是本研究的個案所需要面對的調整與適

應中的艱辛過程。

研究者接觸及了解後所引發之同理成為個案當下的支持力量，而研究者與個案在相

同文化背景及年代生活下，成為那個可以聽得懂個案所描述現象的人，個案頓時覺得不

孤單，也能夠因著這樣的支撐拓展及影響其他生活範圍，可以說是從「問題點」到「涉

及的層面」再到「真實的現象場」，因此治療介入後所引起的改變也是需要治療室中的

狀況與實際生活兩相分析比對。

二、本土女性之自我發展

楊中芳（1991）首先提出在儒家文化下華人的自我發展，其歷程主要是經由道德標

準與社會規範的內化而逐漸形成。Markus  與  Kitayama（1991）提出自我建構理論，概

分為「互依我」（Interdependent self-construal）和「獨立我」 （Independent self-construal）

兩種。何友暉等（1991）在關係取向的架構下提出，中國人的自我可以說是關係性的自

124

我，個人與他人之間無法區隔開來。華人則是發展互依包容的自我為基礎的社會取向自

我實現的原型概念。陸洛（2003）提及現代華人社會已發展出一套兼容並蓄中國傳統「互

依包容的自我」與西方文化「獨立自足的自我」的「折衷自我」。另外針對華人自我的

研究尚有楊國樞（2004）提及華人自我的建構是以個人取向及社會取向的概念架構為基

礎。陸洛和楊國樞（2005）整理西方文化是以發展獨立自主的自我為基礎的個人取向自

我實現的原型概念。

至於在華人自我發展與關係上的探討，陳秉華（1995）在一篇大學女生與父母心理

—情感衝突與改變歷程的研究中提到，個案內在尋求自主的同時，卻經歷著離開父母的

罪惡感。羅國英（1997）更提出了國內青少年在親子關係中所承受的需要回報父母恩的

壓力，在劉惠琴（1998）更探討青少女在與母親關係離與合時較少採用分離模式。而

Josselson（1980）也提醒分離的自我也並非指孤獨之意，也仍是在關係中成為他自己。

研究者體會到華人的自我發展，尤其女孩更難用分離的模式來獨立自我，常處於又想要

保有自我卻又想保有關係中的矛盾中，因此在轉化的過程中也只能透過覺察及表達來部

分滿足想要形成的自我。而許詩淇等（2020）更揭示了華人親子關係中義務取向與關係

主義下的義務與權利互動形式為只問盡義務，不求享權利的樣態。

由此也可以看到本研究中的個案正面臨獨立自主以及傳統孝道中照顧家庭的性別

角色期待之兩難，再加上個案在自我犧牲，以照顧家庭當作回報時可能還被家人肯定或

是鼓舞，這更容易造成個案心中的矛盾，也是本土女性自我發展上經常遭遇的議題。華

人的自我，受到道德標準與社會規範所規範，並且衍生出自我修養歷程，而本研究中的

個案也造就相當敏感於反省或是自我批評的特質，甚至在公開我及私密我的部分表現相

差極大，不免出現矛盾或自我衝突。

三、個案的身心症—重鬱症

美國精神病學會（American Psychiatric Association, APA）（2013/2014）最新第五版

本美國精神疾病分類與診斷標準中提及，至少在兩週內，包含 9 項內容中的 5 項或以上

屬重鬱發作。本研究中個案包括的困擾有：憂鬱心情，幾乎整天、每日都有。在所有或

幾乎所有的活動、興趣或喜樂都顯著減少。每日失眠且疲累失去活力。幾乎每日有無價

值感或過分或不合宜的罪惡感、思考能力或專注能力減退或無決斷力，並且反覆想到死

亡且曾有過自殺嘗試或已有實行自殺的特別計劃。

另外個案也表示經常做惡夢，而惡夢在國內外文獻中與身心症狀的相關的有：惡夢

與睡眠障礙、心理困擾、憂鬱、神經質特質、創傷後壓力症候群及焦慮症狀（Bolstad et

al., 2021; Dassel et al., 2018; Martina & Reinhard, 2001）；並且惡夢困擾、頻率和重複性

也都與創傷後壓力症候群（PTSD）症狀（Dassel et al., 2018）及自殺相關（Shianne et al.,

125

2020）。另外，惡夢與個人現實生活問題或是個人特質及情緒相關的有：惡夢所引起身

體不適，也被認為他們的生活出了問題，並催促他們解決個人問題（Martin & Reinhard,

2001）；以及個體的自我力量可以部分解釋與惡夢、神經質特質和心理困擾狀態關聯

（William, 2020）。Weinstein 等（2017）在日常生活和重複夢境關聯的研究中發現，生

活經歷中的挫折感在引發夢中的負向情緒方面有重要影響。經常遭受惡夢折磨的人較非

惡夢經驗的人消極及較多負面情緒（Franc et al., 2021）。最後在治療惡夢部分：認知行

為治療可增加對於夢的與內容控制與減少創傷後惡夢困擾（Harb et al., 2016），並已有

研究證明認知行為治療在躁鬱症患者上是有效的（Miller et al., 2018）；也有使用認知行

為治療在處遇失眠合併夢遊的議題（翁欣凱、葉在庭，2013）。意義治療以及焦點解決

短期治療，主要是幫助夢者在夢境醒來後做出更有能力、更少恐懼的反應，並對白天的

功能產生積極影響（Ellis, 2016）。

因此本研究中對於個案的處遇中也包括了對於惡夢的處遇，由於惡夢對於個案而言

是抽象的並且引發負面情緒，因此透過表達性藝術治療的過程可以藉由沙盤物件的使用、

黏土創作抑或是經由個案心中印象深刻的童話敘說，幫助個案呈現內在潛意識的部分來

幫助個案覺察及辨識。再者個案也在接觸多元媒材的過程，可以更多的去表達及釋放長

期壓抑在心中的情緒，而個案與潛意識接觸的過程中也增加了可以多元的視角去看待自

身問題的能力，而不再是從單一面向，治療的介入幫助個案的思考出現彈性及鬆動固著

無望念頭的可能。

四、榮格取向表達性藝術治療

本研究所使用之榮格取向之表達性藝術治療內容包括：沙盤治療、以黏土創作配合

釋夢以及童話解析等，均是以使用表達性藝術治療多元媒材介入的部分，Jung（1961）

也曾表示透過使用藝術媒材表達內心世界，有助於人的內在與外在合為一體。藝術本身

即能療癒，讓壓抑的潛意識得以視覺化並提升到意識層次，並能將潛意識中的原型攫取

出來轉換為象徵圖像（徐玟玲，2021），圖像又可以使得象徵成孕，讓圖像活了起來（Nora,

2018/2022），即藝術創作中圖解式的意象視為圖畫裡的生命（Schaverien, 1992）。其各

種介入內容說明分述如下：

（一）沙盤治療與超越功能

此療法提供了一個自由且受保護的空間（Kalff, 1980），個案可以在這裡表達和體

驗因早期創傷、遺棄或剝奪而引起的情緒；其所建立的自由保護的關係就像母親對孩子

的愛，是療癒及轉化不可或缺的重要因素（Kalff, 1980）。Weinrib  （2004）觀察到沙盤

所發揮功能的動力和 Winnicott 所謂的「過渡性客體」（transitional object）所採用的移

126

情方式極為神似。黃宗堅（2005）認為個案手觸碰沙子產生「動覺經驗」（Kinesthtic

experience）使其關注焦點從外在轉到內在，沙遊物件吸引個案，是因為它們激起了個案

抑制的心靈元素並呈現出來，以及治療師創造一個安全的空間並透過文字、拍攝沙盤記

錄與個案討論與個人意義的事物連結。而 Mitchell 與 Friedman（2003）提出在沙盤中可

以觀察以下現象：個案的能量點、困擾點、出現哪些類型的現象群集、呈現的力量或資

源，以及在沙盤中呈現了哪些創傷的象徵。基於上述的內容，可以了解沙盤治療的過程

可提供安全且涵容的環境，有助於個體從外在世界轉向內在世界進行修復，因此在本研

究中可當作諮商的引入點，在個案面對自傷自殺議題難言之隱或是議題複雜，提供方法

促進談話治療無法碰觸的感受或議題，並且能夠達到表達及轉化的果效。

而 超 越 功 能 是 一 種 心理 功 能 ， 是 由 意 識 和無 意 識 內 容 的 結 合 而產 生 的 Jung

（1916/2014），超越功能首先必須有無意識的材料，一般是採用夢的內容或是自發性的

幻想（Jung,  1964/2013）。對成人來說，完滿自足的狀態要經由心靈的意識與潛意識的

融合才能達成，榮格認為心靈超越功能，讓個體本我的潛力完全實現（Jung, 1916/2014）。

Kalsched（2013/2022）談超越功能的重要性時提及，這個介於我們私人主體性和互為主

體性之間的空間，是治癒我們覺得無法承受之處而從一個世界逃遁到另一個世界。

（二）榮格取向釋夢

1.  釋夢的意義

榮格曾提及，夢的象徵符號不可能與夢者的情境脈絡分開來處理，必須依照夢本身

的前因後果來考量（Jung,  1964/2013）。黃宗堅（2007）提及榮格釋夢用集體潛意識的

概念，並強調其原則在於直覺與個別化的彈性態度。故研究者認為透過夢境的探索與解

析，促進自我和潛意識內容搭起橋樑的重要媒介，幫助個案探尋心靈及覺醒或是從困頓

經驗中找到方向與力量。

2.  釋夢的階段

Johnson（1986）以榮格理論為基礎架構，將釋夢歷程以四個階段來進行，分別是聯

想、心理動力探索、詮釋與儀式化。

（1）聯想－積極想像與擴大

Johnson（1986）提到在夢中的任何一個象徵，都是潛意識已經準備好可以透過聯想

來尋找其意義與隱喻，內容可分為「積極想像」（active  imagination）和「擴大法」

（amplification）。黃宗堅（2007）提及積極想像是榮格釋夢工作中深化夢境意義的技術；

而擴大是對夢中的原型和意象進行意象性的擴展、延伸。Kalsched（2013/2022）提及擴

大法是 Jung 在面對夢境集體素材時所使用的技巧，匯集字詞聯想、神話、宗教圖像等。

積極想像也是榮格理論重要的方法（申荷永，2004）。積極想像的重點在於讓無意識幻

想流入無自我的真空內及融入日常生活中（Tibaldi, 2010/2017）。

127

（2）心理動力的探索

主要是找出夢與夢者內在情緒的事件、內在人格的活化、感受、態度、價值觀或心

情等。

（3）詮釋

此部分的重點是夢要表達的核心訊息及給予的建議，因此任何的詮釋都必須是由夢

者認可。黃韻寧（2016）提及在面對情結議題時的和解及整合可能獲得新的詮釋，進而

能夠切身體會到萬物間存有實然的狀態與對人真正的慈悲。

（4）儀式化

此部分主要是夢者帶著探索夢境的結果回到日常生活中，讓夢者在這過程中了解與

自身之關聯，並幫助夢者體驗更多來自心靈的覺醒或是從困頓經驗中找到新的意義。

（三）榮格取向童話治療

Von Franz（1970/2018）是榮格取向童話治療最早的提倡者，他認為童話呈現較純

粹的象徵與原型（Johnson, 1991/2021）。郭蕙寧和黃宗堅（2017）表示童話蘊含象徵語

言，能表達人類長久下來所累積的心靈經驗。Kast（2004/1986）認為童話故事能投射出

人們的心聲與內心渴望，以一種象徵的形式使人們看見自己生命的困境。

研究者試圖透過表達性藝術治療可提供安全的環境，搭配多元表達性媒材，協助個

案抒發情緒或是揭露自身所承受長期身心症狀之苦，有助於個體從外在世界轉向內在世

界進行修復。

壹、研究方法

研究方法主要分為研究問題與目的、研究設計、程序與工具、嚴謹性、倫理及研究

參與者等部分。

一、研究問題與目的

本研究欲從本土心理學觀點理解一位重度憂鬱症女性經歷童年創傷後，透過表達性

藝術治療的介入之轉化經驗；所使用榮格心理分析取向表達性藝術治療內容包括：透過

沙盤治療、夢的解析以及童話隱喻分析的過程，所發生的轉化經驗所產生的離苦得樂之

道有更深刻的了解與應用。

二、研究設計

128

本研究是以主題分析法（thematic analysis）探究治療主題的內涵，此法為處理研究

資料中蘊含的重要模式，並發現其與研究問題間的關聯（Braun & Clarke, 2006）。在分

析步驟上，則是參考高淑清（2008）的觀點，並以下列程序進行研究資料的分析：

1.  清楚且詳實撰寫個案紀錄與相關研究資料的蒐集，以使研究資料盡可能呈現原

有的現象。

2.  研究者以開放的態度反覆閱讀文本，並寫下對於文本的理解與省思。

3.  研究過程中發現事件與視框的脈絡，並將與主題有關的訊息進行標記、編碼與

註解，再逐步檢視這些意義單元，以利於未來主題的歸納。

4.  透過反覆閱讀後對於文本有整體性理解。

5.  分析經驗結構與意義再建構或再次發現新的意義單元。

6.  確認共同主題與反思，並呈現重要主題且給予命名。

本研究試以「權力／控制」主題進行舉例編碼過程說明。

三、徵求參與者（個案）並收集資料

129

本研究個案諮商部分在轉介研究者時，已由轉介單位請個案填寫諮商同意書，其中

已充分說明諮商過程中有關錄音、錄影及治療中須拍照個案治療創作品的部分，因此研

究者根據每次的錄音檔做紀錄，並於治療結案後，研究者進行研究內容撰寫前，向個案

說明研究目的，並針對資料的收集方式、保密性及研究倫理說明後並簽署同意書再次獲

得個案同意願意參與本研究及會談資料的使用。

四、研究程序及工具

（一）研究程序

研究者在個案同意下進行治療及錄音，隨後謄寫逐字稿，並進行文本分析，根據詮

釋出來的理解，著手撰寫研究結果與討論。其文本編碼的說明如下：

1.  編碼分為三個段落，分別代表〔說話者〕-〔會談次數〕-〔對話流水編號〕。

2.  R 代表研究者流水編號。

3.  C 代表研究參與者（個案）流水編號。

4.  F 代表研究參與者（個案父親）流水編號。

舉例：C-01-001 表示個案在第一次會談說的第一句話。R-02-002 表示研究者在第二

次會談說的第二句話。

（二）研究工具

研究中使用錄音設備、知情同意書。選用錄音紀錄，主要是錄音檔可以呈現個案和

研究者晤談的實際內容和聲音，分析個案議題及經驗感受，並探討相關變項（林家興，

2017）。

（三）研究量表

Lee  等（2003）發展簡式健康量表為一種自陳式量表，內容包括 5 題症狀之題組，

分別測量焦慮、憤怒、憂鬱、自卑與失眠等常見之心理困擾嚴重度；以及 1 題的自殺評

估，使用目的為精神疾患之篩檢，進而提供所需心理衛生服務。

本量表每個題目之計分方式為 0~4 分，0 分：完全沒有、1 分：輕微、2 分：中等程

度、3 分：厲害、4 分：非常厲害。總分為 0~20 分，使用時其區辨精神疾患之最佳切割

點為 6 分，將總分（症狀或心理困擾之嚴重度）分為下列幾個等級：1 至 5 題之總分，

得分：0~5 分為身心適應狀況良好。得分：6~9 分為輕度情緒困擾，建議給予情緒支持。

得分：10~14 分為中度情緒困擾，建議轉介精神科治療或接受專業諮詢。得分：大於 15

分為重度情緒困擾，建議轉介精神科治療或接受專業諮詢。另外，第 6 題（有無自殺意

130

念）單項評分本題為附加題，若前五題總分小於 6 分，但本題評分為 2 分以上（中等程

度）時，宜考慮轉介至精神科。

簡 式 健 康 量 表 信 效 度 經 由 不 同 (cid:13687) 群 分 析 顯 示 各 次 量 表 有 良 好 之 內 在 一 致 性

（Cronbach’s  α=  .77-.90），再測信度為.82，與 Mini-International  Neuropsychological

Interview  schedule 精神疾患診斷結果做比較，以六分做為量表切分點可得 78.9%之敏感

度、74.3%之特異性，同時有 76.3%之正確診斷率。

五、研究嚴謹性

本研究中所使用之治療資料來自個案所主動進行的治療過程，資料有可靠的來源。

本研究質性分析個案治療的逐字稿，為了增加研究資料的可靠程度，研究者除了進修諮

商與輔導博士班專業課程之外更接受督導，透過督導者從客觀且專業的視框，共同協助

檢視個案所敘說的訊息。本研究透過資料來源及理論的三角校正進行驗證，說明如下：

（一）資料來源三角驗證

研究資料收集亦透過轉介機構、家屬等多方資料，交叉檢核觀察紀錄的正確性。研

究者透過與個案檢核文本內容符合程度平均達 90％，以確保受訪內容無誤解或是扭曲。

（二）理論三角檢驗

本研究並參酌客體關係理論進行探討及詮釋，在文本分析過程中與研究合作者互相

比對觀點，減少資料的系統性偏見，並提高內容分析品質和可信性。最後研究者亦將結

果寄給個案，以確定公開資料內容，避免侵害隱私。

六、研究倫理

研究者向個案說明本研究並得到同意書。為確保個案的權益，因此於治療期間並未

著手進行任何與研究相關計畫，其目的是為要讓研究者單一身分，以臨床心理師之身分

進行治療的過程，並且接受臨床督導，以確保個案在治療上最大的福祉，在進行研究過

程中，有關資料收集、逐字稿撰寫均刪除可辨識出個案身分的訊息，以保障其權益。

七、研究參與者

（一）研究者

131

研究者（第一作者）為臨床心理師，從事醫療及教育工作 16 年，目前就讀諮商與

輔導學系博士班並接受督導，已修習諮商理論專題相關課程，這些專業訓練均成為本研

究之基石。在此研究中擔任心理師、文字轉錄者及資料分析者等角色，每個角色均有適

當的間隔及準備時間，以求資料的清楚及完備。研究者並與研究合作者共同進行內容分

析，同時參考家庭會談紀錄、簡式健康量表（BSRS-5）施測結果等，進行三角檢驗以提

升研究的信效度。

（二）研究合作者

研究合作者亦為臨床心理師，目前亦為就讀諮商與輔導學系博士班學生，並修習過

曾修習諮商理論專題相關課程，目前於醫療院所工作並接受客體關係督導 10 多年。在

本研究中擔任研究資料分析與修正，以提高本研究之信效度。

（三）個案小美（化名）基本資料

1.  轉介單位及家屬所提供內容

此部分的訊息來自於研究者與轉介單位及父親的談話中所收集到的資料。本研究個

案化名為小美，年約 25-30 歲的單身女性，小美因罹患重度憂鬱症，並且表示有自傷行

為及自殺的意念，因此小美已至身心科診所門診治療及服藥及自殺通報，另外因為身心

狀況不佳，故由父親建議小美接受自費心理治療，就在小美同意後，父親曾向轉介機構

表示願意支付無限次數之諮商費用，只希望個案不要尋死！研究者可以感受到父親對於

小美身心狀況的擔心，似乎是不計一切的希望小美可以恢復心理的健康，同時也看到在

傳統的父親形象下，這或許是父親在表達對於孩子的愛，但是卻無法直接對孩子說愛，

這裡也看到傳統華人父系社會下父女之間的情感流露，是這樣的內斂及內隱，而也只有

在生死交關時，才會在醫療人員面前表露出來。

2.  個案對於過去身心狀況描述

        在會談中得知小美表示：

「過去曾有接受過心理治療的經驗，在接受諮商過程中如果覺得與會談的

心理師不適合，談過一次就不會再去，所以曾經換過好幾位心理師。」（C-

01-007）

心理師聽到這樣的內容一方面覺得小美做事情果斷，但是一方面自己也感受到協助

小美的壓力，因此也對於關係的建立格外的小心謹慎，這首次的會談也會是決定小美日

後是否持續接受治療的關鍵。

在會談內容中得知，小美在大學畢業後曾短暫工作，而待業至今已 5 年的時間，在

此期間小美備受身心症的影響痛苦不已。從小美的原生家庭可以了解，年幼時父母離異，

132

從此以後身為獨生女的小美成為父母感情不睦下的代罪羔羊或是在父親家(cid:13687)中論及父

母離異時的投射對象，在家(cid:13687)中父親身為長子且個案為獨生女，小美表示：

「經常莫名承受來自傳統家庭文化傳宗接代及光宗耀祖的觀念，更不喜歡

自己的女性性別，平常以中性打扮、騎打檔車。」（C-01-010）

因此就心理師的觀察長相柔美、溫柔婉約的小美平時大多是將一頭長髮紮起，行為

舉止相當幹練及男性化，想要扮演分擔家庭壓力以及凝聚家(cid:13687)情感的角色。

小美在 15 歲前與母親同住的日子裡飽受母親情緒躁鬱之苦，在學業英語方面之要

求甚高已超過小美可以負荷的壓力，小美不從就會被處罰，幾乎是沒有選擇及表達的機

會，並且從小就相當壓抑且承受許多來自母親不穩定的情緒及肢體暴力對待，這樣的情

形一直維持到 15 歲讀高中前。但小美也表示，後來大學讀外文系並且有出國留學的機

會，這也是因為英語能力較佳所帶來的優勢。從這裡約略可以體會到小美從小生活的處

境是在極度被限制且控制的狀態下，除了讀書沒有其他生活發展可言，而母親的情緒波

動也造成了小美極度敏感、脆弱、容易恐懼以及受虐的心理狀態。

小美 15 歲後因升學及經濟考量搬至與父親同住，小美從小到大與誰同住的議題都

是由父母決定，因此可以離開母親的控管，這對長期遭受精神壓力及暴力對待的小美而

言可以說是鬆了一口氣，緊接著小美在會談中表示：

「直到搬至爸爸家同住後，曾經在一次與爸爸在賣場結帳時與媽媽相遇，我

仍不敢直視媽媽，害怕媽媽會再責罵只敢躲在爸爸身後偷偷看著媽媽。」（C-

01-015）

對於成年後的小美而言，回想 15 歲前與母親相處的害怕感受直到會談時仍依稀記

得、難以忘懷，並且至今也未曾再與母親互動。但是與父親同住的小美也出現相處的問

題，由於父女雙方過去長年鮮少互動，再加上青春期的小美對於自己的角色認同或是人

際相處都正處於在找自我定位的階段，許多自我的概念也都處於矛盾衝突狀態，例如：

我為何會生在這樣的家庭？我為何存在這世界？我是怎樣的人？我喜歡怎樣的自己或

他人？對於自身的存在議題也開始很多的疑惑，但是小美也發現自己與父親雙方的表達

方式都是處於較被動且壓抑的方式，以至於雙方關係及溝通處於停滯的狀態，小美在尋

求諮商時表示自己與家人的關係是這樣的讓人窒息，從與母親的相處接近在受虐下壓力

高張、情緒崩潰的形勢，再到與父親的相處又是這樣冰冷、孤立無援、缺乏彈性的狀態

下，最重要的是小美一點也不喜歡自己，更不想要這樣的活著，小美深刻地感受到似乎

也只有自己一死才能結束這樣的痛苦。

133

貳、研究結果

一、諮商目標與歷程

諮商目標為處遇個案內在匱乏及創傷的議題，從上述研究者訪談個案對於過去身心

狀況描述中可以發現，來自傳統家(cid:13687)文化的要求與壓力對於個案影響甚鉅，以下將透過

榮格取向之表達性藝術治療的介入更進一步了解個案從不瞭解自己的情緒，透過沙盤治

療可以說是讓個案透過視覺以及觸覺感受到自己的潛意識及情緒是何等的強烈，過去個

案一直無法安放自己，也因著強烈的情緒讓個案感受到自我的存在，讓好好照顧自己這

件事情有了好的開始，因此在後續夢的解析、童話治療中看見個案更多的釋放過去所壓

抑的情緒，其中有悲傷、憂鬱、寂寞，同時也有好奇、幽默以及厭惡之感受，對於個案

而言可以學習調節與因應，更進一步幫助小美體現內在母親情結的糾葛，從中找尋內心

和解之道。在會談後期，個案與父親的親子會談中更是在熱淚滿盈中，融化冰釋了過去

父女倆心中的冰山，那一層層未曾說出心中的感受真實的表達出來，同時個案也在往後

的會談中逐漸地緩和對於自我的攻擊及傷害的行為，而走向可以選擇、能夠調整自我整

合的自己，得以找尋新的生活目標及重心。研究者採用榮格取向觀點分析及了解個案在

表達性藝術治療中的內容，諮商過程包括個別會談 12 次及親子會談 1 次（父女），說

明如下：

表 2

各次的會談內容表
會談次數
第 1 及 2 次會談

  了解個案主訴、澄清諮商目標及建立醫病關係。

內容

第 3 及 4 次會談

  研究者透過進行沙盤治療的過程，幫助個案表達童年母親控制或暴力對待的

陰影，以及所造成日後壓抑及憂鬱等隱而未現的感受。

第 5 次會談

  研究者發現個案在前一次治療時，體會到沙盤治療過程所帶來與潛意識的靠

近，並且對於所引發的情緒或想法有所抗拒，因此個案表示本次不願意再做

沙盤治療。研究者故改為安排個案體驗超越功能。

第 6 及 7 次會談

  個案主動帶來惡夢夢境向研究者訴說，因此研究者也透過黏土創作幫助個案

投射釋夢。

第 8 及 9 次會談

  研究者發現個案透過表達性藝術治療後對於精神情緒狀態有成效，因此更詢

問個案從小到大是否有印象深刻之童話，再由個案提出後研究者解析，也看

見親子的議題中目前是與父親的關係需要修復。

第 10 次會談

  個案與父親的親子會談。

第 11-13 次會談

  個案之個別會談三次，研究者除了持續地進行治療並核對個案生活脈絡之更

新後結案。

134

二、個案概念化

小美從小在父母關係不佳的家庭中成長，幼年即面臨父母離異後單親的生活，一開

始與母親同住的 15 年中承受高度學業壓力以及經常遭受肢體及精神暴力的對待，也造

就小美較為壓抑且容易緊張的個性，在青春期後與父親同住，而父親為公司 CEO，居於

要職多忙於工作，且父女雙方長久的關係疏離，終至小美出現憂鬱症狀及自殺的念頭。

而小美自小又因父母婚姻長期溝通不良、相互猜忌爭吵問題下承受許多精神壓力，理性

上認同父親但是情感上又與母親較親近的矛盾衝突。另外，在家(cid:13687)中父親身為長子且個

案為獨生女的情況下，個案又需要承受來自家庭文化需要傳宗接代及光宗耀祖的壓力，

而盡孝道的觀念更督促小美在成年之後需要在凝聚家(cid:13687)情感上扮演重要的角色，成為小

美對於與父母相處或是家(cid:13687)成員間高度要求壓力的陰影。

在成年後的生活中，小美經常會有生無可戀的想法，個案自覺達不到自身要求或不

如人時崩潰痛哭，小美也對於父母親的認同處於矛盾且衝突的狀態，在情感上渴望與母

親連結，透過小美在沙盤治療中兩隻大小鱷魚間的互動可以略窺一二，也就是說在父親

的家中的小鱷魚是在巫婆家的大鱷魚所生，並且從巫婆家送至父親家居住，像極了個案

15 歲時因為就學被送至父親家居住的事實，但是個案對於母親情結沒有消失，仍透過小

美性格讓與母親相似之處深深的連結著，而父親只善於工作賺錢養家卻不善於情感表達

的部分也造成與小美間的情感疏離。研究者參酌 Klein（1946）客體關係對憂鬱症的論

述，個體會將對於死亡本能的憤恨投射至壞的乳房或是陰莖上，但也會將愛的感覺投射

出去，當個體發現是投射在同一人身上時，就形成了憂鬱。在現實生活中小美一直沒有

發展出自己生活重心，更會因為回想痛苦的過去讓小美經常懷疑自己存在的意義，甚至

用自殺的方式想要攻擊自己。

透過諮商，研究者協助小美表達及釐清心中許多感受，並且協助小美區分父母婚姻

的問題以及自我成長過程中發展的議題，小美在過程中經常淚流不止，似乎也更加顯示

了小美渴望被了解，以及過去可能從未被好好理解或是對待過的經驗。而榮格取向之表

達性藝術治療對於嚴重情緒困擾之個案提供了涵容的空間，使得個案有機會可以面對對

立面及陰影，進而產生轉化之存在感及意義感。

三、治療介入

（一）沙盤治療

圖 1

沙盤全圖

135

1.  初始沙盤解析

在初始沙盤（圖 1）中可以看到物件的使用類別及數量相當的豐富，Kalff（1980）

認為初始沙盤至少有幾種特徵，個案對於治療的感受、個案和潛意識之間的關係、個案

的問題或困擾以及可能的解決方式。個案在沙盤的下半部呈現原始動物的本能，在沙盤

中人類的角色是領導或是統御，因此可以了解人類在沙盤中所展現的主要是以功能性為

主，而榮格提到功能性對意識具有決定性的影響力（Sharp, 2012/1983），沙盤中其他物

件則以動物為大多數，小美表示：

「我是第一次嘗試沙遊治療，將沙盤取名為我的世界，沙盤正中間是水池，

我擺完後覺得水池不夠大，動物們需透過兔子先生的溝通來認識彼此，所以

大家都是朋友。」（C-03-003）

沙盤分成 5 個部分，物件擺放的方位象徵內在世界的狀態（Ruth,  1998）；分別是

左上角父親的家、右上角母親的家、正中間水池、左下角古蹟以及右下角整群恐龍。第

一個放入的物件是橋樑，而水池意味著小美內在與潛意識的接觸，從沙盤中的位置及大

小看起來是正中央屬於核心的位置但是接觸的範圍還不大，也可能是小美心中對於潛意

識的接觸還有所顧忌，同時也可能隱藏或壓抑了許多情緒及事件，這也可能是小美從小

與高壓管教的母親學習來的方式。而在水池中的魚又是擁擠堆疊在一起，如同過江之鯽，

與優遊自在在水中的狀態相去甚遠，也可以看出小美心中對於競爭要如何存活下去有很

136

強烈的感受。另外，小美選擇兔子先生作為溝通其他動物的主要角色，兔子的柔軟及跳

躍象徵彈性，並且狡兔有三窟，也表示靈活或是狡詐，西方以兔子作為復活節的象徵之

一（Matthews, 1993; Terri, 2006）。從兔子的象徵都可以顯示出小美的內心世界也可能具

有彈性及問題解決的能力。

在左下角代表小美內在的部分也看到擺放了許多古蹟，體會到個案念舊以及受到傳

統家庭文化影響的程度，以及集體潛意識中古老文化、傳統深深影響著小美，就像是在

外縣市就讀外語文系的小美卻每週回到鄉下陪伴爺爺及奶奶，協助家(cid:13687)親戚溝通協調，

呈現家和萬事興的樣貌及盡孝道，也部分替代了母親身為媳婦在家(cid:13687)中的角色，這對於

重鬱症的小美而言，當內心的傳統與外在的現代化相衝擊時，研究者觀察個案有可能因

為身心症而出現與世事隔離的現象，就像是站在古蹟(cid:13673)的外星人或是太空人一般的突兀。

而從古代到現代文明的跨越，也可以看見超越功能的展現，如同擺放在古蹟(cid:13673)的草地與

覆蓋在雪中沒有生命的古蹟的場景，形成了強烈的對比，Kalsched（2013/2022）也曾提

及綠色在植物形式中是生命及新生的顏色，期待著總有一天春天的來臨，也是小美內心

希望轉化的來臨。

右下角大量數量的恐龍，象徵原初的攻擊性，可能是和生存防衛有關（Matthews,

1993），似乎數量要夠多小美才能安心，並且小美在擺放恐龍的方式是將全部的恐龍物

件倒進沙箱中。

2.  初始沙盤中的內容

（1）兩個家的現況

        小美表示：

「沙盤中有兩個家，一個是目前與爸爸住的家以及另一個是巫婆的家。現實

中的爸爸屬於書生型，做事態度慢條斯理，但是決策很有魄力，並且平常也

沒有看到甚麼情緒的反應，經常是(cid:1286)於工作，爸爸在工作中有很優秀的表現；

在沙盤中還有隻我最喜歡的小鱷魚是巫婆送的，我也希望可以和巫婆保持

友好的關係，但鱷魚很火爆，像是脾氣很不好的人，就像媽媽也像我；想起

媽媽暴躁的情緒，平常關心我但也對於生活及學業(cid:1291)就表現要求甚高，會希

望我行為舉止要像淑女，(cid:1291)績要優秀，尤其英文能力要(cid:1291)為佼佼者，不如媽

媽的心意就被肢體或是言語暴力對待。」（C-03-009）

個案在沙盤治療時提及兩個家，分別是父親的家與巫婆的家，其中父親的家有食物

的提供可以滋養小美，另外也看見有許多軍事的交通工具，似乎與父親身為科技業或是

有紀律有極大的關係，同時也象徵具有強大的財富或控制力；至於論及巫婆的家以及有

許多怪獸守護這部分之前，則是可以先了解巫婆的象徵，在 Kalsched（1996/2018）提及

137

巫婆可視為心靈自我麻痺或解離、凍結、內部催眠自我的能力。這與小美跟母親的關係

相像，雙方關係屬於緊密卻也高張力，母親對於小美的高度控制及要求，經常讓小美覺

得窒息或喘不過氣，希望個案可以有所成就光宗耀祖。同時小美也覺察到自己也有脾氣

很暴躁的部分和母親相似，如同巫婆的家有許多怪獸守護一樣，母親是以較原始的本能

對待小美，小美也承襲了這樣的本能，同時卻要壓抑自己的本能與母親互動，長期相處

下來則出現自我懷疑存在的意義；尤其是當小美在生活及工作的表現上不如預期時，小

美對於自己的失望，更不想要成為他人的負擔，這也是促成小美出現自傷行為或自殺意

念的主要原因。母親的角色對於小美而言所呈現的高度要求及攻擊行為，使得小美心中

存有負向的母親情結，則由巫婆形象呈現出陰影。當小美面對自己的陰影，了解這是過

去的自我保護系統，也看見其中個案所賴以生存的，不是去否定它的存在，而是逐漸的

去了解並且學習如何與母親及和自己相處的契機。

而兩個家的議題要在小美的內在走向整體性，其天然的純真必須承受經驗性的磨難，

就像是小美所歷經痛不欲生的苦難，甚至於罹患重鬱症的結果，這些也都像是 Kalsched

（2013/2022）所言，這個歷程中所需承受的磨難，必須是在意識中經驗龐大的悲傷和哀

慟。但也唯有走過這歷程，也才有可能走向轉化，走出困頓的自我。

（2）真性情化解人際困境

Johnson（1991/2021）提到陰影是我們的存在中受到厭惡的區塊；而故事中巫婆把

小鱷魚送給了小美，成為小美最喜歡的禮物，似乎潛意識也是要小美去面對生命中的陰

影。小美在自由聯想時想到了過去自己與同學相處的點點滴滴，小美表示因為自己說話

有娃娃音，所以過去經常讓同學覺得小美很做作因而遭受排擠，直到有次小美與同學對

話時講了較粗俗的話，反而讓同學覺得親切且有趣，這樣的事件似乎也讓小美發現自己

真性情的一面是有助於人際關係，而真性情也讓小美想起母親，也成為母親給小美人生

的禮物，因此母親是小美的陰影，卻也是禮物，這一體兩面的理解也幫助小美心中漸漸

取得平衡，也找到面對挫折時的立足點。

（3）個案的潛能出現

在沙盤正中央小美表示：

「有位潛水員會聽命於兔子先生，因為兔子天性怕水，所以需要專業潛水員

來協助，兔子先生透過潛水員不斷與其他動物們的溝通，並且目前動物們相

處的情形是和平共存。」（C-03-012）

在過程中幫助水中及陸上的動物們交流，而潛水員的形象出現也傳遞赫密斯

（Hermes）的象徵。他是邊界之神，是遊蕩在陸地與海洋間的路徑之神，本質上是存在

於過渡的時間與空間之中（Stein, 1987/2013）；在潛意識中也看見了小美對於自身處在

138

水中及陸上的過渡，因此從榮格取向表達性藝術治療的過程中，幫助小美看見了自己解

決問題以及對於事物反應的能力，面對自己做不到的事情會尋求資源，而非靠自己一個

人的力量拚搏，也就是個案在處理事情上有很彈性且靈活的部分。

（4）原始本能及慾望

在沙盤下方小美擺放了很多恐龍的物件，小美挑選出治療室中所有恐龍的物件後，

全部放入沙盤中，小美表示因為很喜歡恐龍，所以想要將所有的恐龍放入盤中；同時，

研究者也觀察到個案明顯地全有全無做事風格，這樣兩極化的明顯好惡，就小美在會談

中表示自己在事情判斷上的確容易呈現較極端的樣貌，另外也是研究者所擔心的——當

小美對於人或事的付出呈現全有的狀態而未能得到相對應的回應，或是對於自己的努力

未能得到回報時，都有可能會出現失落或憂鬱的感受。從象徵來看，動物也代表本能的

部分（施玉麗，2016），而恐龍是具有強大、暴力、攻擊且豐沛的力量（Matthews, 1993），

這部分的力量若處理不當也有可能會傷害自己或是他人，而小美看起來是傷害自己的成

分較大，對於他人則是想要在自己事業上功成名就及經濟許可後對父親的回饋，也可以

了解小美想要盡孝道的心意。

（5）釋放卻也耗竭的感受

小美透過沙盤治療將內心的世界以及家庭的問題表達出來，並藉此過程抒發壓抑的

感受及憂鬱的情緒，小美表示：

「我擺完沙盤後覺得很舒暢但是也覺得很累，舒暢的是我將喜歡的物件全

部放入沙盤中，累的是有種心力交瘁的感受，同時也會擔心我的情緒如果一

湧而出是否會崩潰？或是我仍不習慣表達心中的感受。」（C-03-020）

因此後續會談有些抗拒再做沙盤治療，從這裡研究者也看到小美心中的矛盾，以及

當觸及到內心深處時的近鄉情怯的狀態，因此也尊重及同意小美的決定，同時也等待及

陪伴小美預備自己去面對問題。

個案在進行沙盤治療中看見兩極對立與渴望被了解的需求，依據 Mitchell  與

Friedman（2003）所提出創傷沙盤的內容中看到小美的初始沙盤已出現：混亂的（chaotic）、

分裂的（split）、受阻的（hindered）、受限制的（comfined）及受威脅的（threatened）

的場景，可以了解小美從小到大所承受的創傷的確是不容忽視。

（二）超越功能的內容

本研究中所使用之超越功能主要是延續沙盤治療中的概念，個案被物件吸引，並且

激發個案將抑制的心靈元素呈現出來，個案依序挑選三樣物件分別代表現在所遇到的問

題、與現在問題相反的物件以及最後將這兩者連結起來的物件（梁信惠，2016），透過

139

個案在這過程中象徵的意義所形成的新的見解，因而產生突破現在問題的核心概念，甚

至鬆動原本個案固著的議題，藉此可以了解當個體超越或是跳脫現在的處境就有找到新

的出路的可能。

研究者判斷小美在初始沙盤完成後表示，覺得自己有達到抒發的效果，但是也覺得

自己因為憂鬱症特別容易心力交瘁，所以表示只願意接受使用超越功能的物件來表達。

圖 2

個案挑選的三個物件

1.  從物件的選擇再次投射出小美喜好分明的特徵

小美表示：

「在物件的選擇上我最喜歡的是小飛鼠，覺得很可愛並且小小的，就像我喜

歡被別人當(cid:1291)年紀最小的來照顧，但是討厭的物件是黑老鼠，因為發現我有

時抱怨事情或人的狀態以及自憐的部分，就很像是黑老鼠。而連結小飛鼠與

黑老鼠的第三個物件是甜點（圖 2），因為我喜歡吃甜點，但是如果黑老鼠

是媽媽，這時候就不想跟媽媽分享甜點，而是將甜點換(cid:1291)馬桶擺在小飛鼠和

黑老鼠之間（圖 3）。」（C-05-005）

圖 3

個案更換的三個物件

140

個案在表達 C-05-005 內容後，將甜點物件換成馬桶物件。

2.  個案本能的展現

小美在體驗超越功能時選了可以走在陸地及在天空飛行的小飛鼠代表自己，以及只

能在地上走動討厭的黑老鼠代表內在對立的一面，如同 Johnson（1991/2021）提到，陰

影是我們的存在中受到厭惡的區塊。因此，原本小美可以與黑老鼠一同享用自己最喜歡

的甜點，而且有自我滋養的象徵意涵，但當小美意識到黑老鼠是母親時，則選擇馬桶來

取代甜點，並且表示不想要跟她一起吃甜點，因母親要求多，對小美多批評，可見個案

心中對於母親的感受負向為多。也像是小美忍受夠了這個負面陰影對自身造成的影響，

內心如同將不想要的東西排泄出去一般，脫離陰暗面的掌控。Kalsched（1996/2018）提

及 Jung 認為陰暗面是個案的自我照護系統並產生解離的防禦，也看到小美的重鬱症或

許也是他在現實世界與陰影對抗的產物，因此唯有透過採取開放的態度去面對陰影才有

可能卸除掉重鬱症的糾纏。

（三）夢的解析內容

1.  夢境

小美表示：

「這是一個古代的夢，夢中有一位婦人帶著兩個小孩，小孩是幼童一男一女，

到祠堂要拜拜求平安，因為身為軍職的先生已不在身邊多日且不知何去何

從。然而就在婦人拜拜時見到了祠堂中池塘的水裡躺著一個裸露的男屍，這

個男屍就正是那位婦人的先生，小美表示在夢中很擔心婦人會受不了打擊

而崩潰大哭，但是沒想到這位婦人看到屍體後並沒有哭，反而踹了那屍體一

腳，我在驚訝之餘也笑了出來，之後夢就醒了。」（C-06-004）

141

研究者在了解小美所敘說的夢境後，邀請小美更進一步將夢境透過黏土創作表現出

來，好讓抽象變成具象的畫面，小美表示同意後創作內容如下：

2.  夢的黏土創作

在黏土創作部分（如圖 4），從圖中可以看到左邊是祠堂，有個紅色的屋頂，在祠

堂中站著三個人，其中一位是婦人，另外兩位是一男一女的小孩，平躺在藍色池塘中裸

體的男屍是婦人從事軍職的先生，小美表示：

「因為先生已經死亡所已將臉部表情打叉，而且嘴角朝下，另外最右邊的是

黃色的山矗立在池塘邊。」（C-06-005）

而祠堂中的三個人的身型，明顯的一大兩小，個案描述為母親帶著兩個孩子正在拜

拜祈求心靈的平安與慰藉。

圖 4

夢境黏土創作圖

3.  夢的解析四階段

（1）聯想

A.  婦人

小美表示：

「我在夢中很擔心婦人會受不了打擊而崩潰大哭，但是沒想到這位婦人看

到屍體後並沒有哭，反而踹了那屍體一腳，我在驚訝之餘也笑了出來，之後

夢就醒了。」（C-06-004）

142

如 C-06-004 逐字稿部份內容，這樣的夢境結果讓小美又驚又喜。

B.  池塘中裸露且平躺著的屍體

小美表示：

「這屍體就是那位婦人去從軍的先生，而且這位先生應該是當初要從軍時

是用不告而別的方式，所以家人也都不知道他的去向，直到戰爭結束想要回

家看家人，但也因為受了重傷，最後卻死在離家附近祠堂中的池塘裡。」（C-

06-008）

C.  兩個小孩

小美表示：

「小孩是一男一女的幼童，因為爸爸不在身邊所以就只能跟著媽媽，對於家

人或是事情並沒有自己的想法。」（C-06-010）

D.  祠堂

小美表示：

「祠堂是屬於家族祭拜祖先的地方，也是一個尋求心靈平靜的地方，家族中

的人只要有甚麼事情不清楚的或是想尋求平安的就會到這個祠堂拜拜。」

（C-06-012）

E.  祠堂的棚子

小美表示：

「這紅色的棚子是後來搭建的，因為可以遮風避雨，這樣才可以好好的拜

拜。」（C-06-014）

在小美敘述的過程可以看見婦人及兩個孩子都遮在棚子下方，與屍體的部分是裸露

地躺在池塘中形成明顯的對比。

F.  山

143

小美表示：

「這是座黃色的山，矗立在祠堂旁邊，而祠堂是建立在人煙罕至的郊區。」

（C-06-015）

G.  池塘

小美表示：

「池塘不大，就設在祠堂的旁邊。」（C-06-016）

夢中的池塘與沙盤中的水池有異曲同工之妙，小美在探索潛意識的想法上明確，只

是範圍仍小，可能有自我設限以及內在的不安全感，因此如何增進小美自主性並且在面

對問題時的解決能力，這也是小美在憂鬱傾向緩解後仍需要進行的議題。

（2）心理動力的探索

A.  個案覺察自己像夢中的婦人

小美表示：

「夢中的婦人很像是自己，有時候會不按牌理出牌的做事情，所以原本以為

婦人知道先生過世會崩潰痛哭，但卻是踹了一腳先生的動作，我覺得很好

笑。」（C-06-020）

研究者也感受到這是小美歷經了 6-7 次會談後第一次展露出的笑容，當下充滿了詼

諧以及輕鬆的氛圍，研究者也相視而笑，似乎此時無聲勝有聲，好像過去縈繞在小美心

中憂鬱的陰霾也漸漸有撥雲見日的喜悅。

B.  個案覺察到內在的犧牲特質

小美表示：

「從軍的先生為國家犧牲，這點也很像自己，因為自己也是會為家人犧牲，

在家族孫子輩中是唯一會每周回老家探視爺爺奶奶的，這部分小美形容犧

牲很多自己的時間，但是也是願意繼續這樣做。」（C-06-022）

C.  個案想起過去同樣有不告而別的行為模式

144

當研究者此時請小美與躺在池塘中的黏土屍體對話，小美表示：

「只想要說以後不要這樣不告而別，雖然知道先生是怕講了去當兵的事情

家人會擔心，但是如果不講，家人可能會覺得失落；談及此也讓小美聯想到

過去出國留學也是不告而別，現在體會到身為家人的失落後，會覺得如果要

出遠門還是想要跟家人道別比較好，不要有所遺憾。」（C-06-024）

這樣的過程也讓小美體會到珍惜與家人相處的時光，就像小美過去一直做到的陪伴，

在這裡也更顯其價值與意義。

D.  個案覺察祠堂有家的象徵

祠堂是供奉祖宗的地方，也有家的意象，小美表示：

「在這個祠堂中覺得平靜，好像每當自己心中有不知所措時也會想要去拜

拜，尋求心靈的平靜。」（C-06-025）

由此發現小美心中對於家的感受是矛盾的，一方面是可以讓小美平靜自己的心的所

在，而另一方面也可以從小美的自述及生長背景中看到家(cid:13687)希望小美可以光宗耀祖或功

成名就，例如，小美表示：

「經常莫名承受來自傳統家庭文化傳宗接代及光宗耀祖的觀念，更不喜歡

自己的女性性別。」（C-01-010）

或是，小美曾表示：

「小美表示媽媽情緒暴躁，平常關心小美也對於生活及學業(cid:1291)就表現要求

甚高，會希望小美行為舉止要像淑女，(cid:1291)績要優秀，尤其英文能力要(cid:1291)為佼

佼者，不如媽媽的心意就被肢體或是言語暴力對待。」（C-03-009）

而小美身為女性的角色在父母離異，且沒有其他手足可以訴苦或是分擔壓力的情況

下，小美經常覺得放不下、對不起、達不到這些需要負起的重擔，這似乎也是讓小美的

過去壓迫的喘不過氣而憂鬱的原因。

（3）詮釋

145

在諮商歷程中，小美表示夢的解析覺得有趣的同時，可以看見小美俏皮或是詼諧的

一面，同時也具有惡作劇者的原型，讓原本悲劇的故事內容變成有些荒誕或是有趣的能

力。因此，也可以發現個案內在自我修復的力量，透過在夢境中自己與自己的對話及發

現，好像讓原本自己覺得又大又難的事情變得可以面對，小美的整體的狀態明顯有趨向

平穩且自在，情緒也可以較輕鬆。另外透過夢的解析可以發現小美相當重視孝道，一方

面是自己與爺爺奶奶的關係一直不錯，所以會想念，另外也看到小美身為孫子輩卻仍需

要為已經離異的父親或母親盡孝的責任。

（4）儀式化

此部分主要是夢者帶著探索夢境的結果回到日常生活中。在過去一旦小美意識到自

己無法有所成就表現而成為家人的累贅時，就開始萌生自我了斷的念頭；而小美這場夢

境中，如同小美對於夢境的感受，從原本因為惡夢所帶來的負向情緒，但是在治療中，

透過述說以及榮格取向表達性藝術黏土的創作，在這過程中小美發現那位不告而別去從

軍先生，就在發現竟死亡在家中祠堂不遠處的池塘中，而這位從軍先生的妻子，也就是

這位婦人看見屍體後踹一腳的反應，與個案本來以為夢境中的婦人會崩潰大哭有相當大

的差異，此舉刺激也回饋了小美，事情的發展不一定是像自己原本想的那樣不好或是悲

戚時，也展露出了重生的笑容及曙光，對事情的看法也增加了彈性及希望感。

（四）童話解析的內容

經過了研究者與小美進行過夢的解析，研究者發現小美在故事的描述上很有自己的

見解與感觸，因此也繼續邀請小美分享從小到大印象較深刻的童話故事，小美也很自然

地說出了兩個故事，分別是聖誕節禮物以及最後一片葉子。

1.  第一個故事：聖誕節禮物

小美表示：

「故事是講一對愛著對方的窮夫妻，並且都想要給對方一個聖誕禮物。結果

妻子將長髮剪了去賣，買了可以將先生懷錶掛起來的鍊子送給他，而先生則

是將懷錶賣了，買了梳子給妻子可以梳長髮。小美說完這故事後覺得意境很

美，因為雙方都是願意賣掉自己最珍貴的東西後，將得到的金錢去買東西送

給對方，都有一顆想要給對方最好的心。」（C-09-002）

在這個故事中看到了犧牲的議題，重點都是在於犧牲自己成全別人，就如同小美將

自己最貴的時間拿來陪伴爺爺奶奶一般，在小美的心中家人是最在乎且重視的。另外也

看到小美心中對於父母離異後，如同破碎後的家庭要如何黏合在一起，似乎小美也盡可

146

能地想要透過盡孝來做到最好，也再次呼應在東方文化中的孝道精神所帶給小美的無形

壓力與桎梏。

2.  第二個故事：最後一片葉子

小美表示：

「故事是在講一個生病的女孩，每天看著窗外樹的葉子一片片落下，並且跟

旁人說當樹葉落下最後一片時也是自己離世時。小女孩在說這話時被警衛

伯伯聽到，因此警衛伯伯就在這棵大樹後方的牆壁上畫了另一棵大樹，而當

樹上的葉子落得越來越稀疏後，小女孩看到了畫在牆上的大樹，竟然仍是這

樣的茂盛，因此小女孩在面對疾病時也產生了信心，說也奇怪，疾病竟也漸

漸好轉，但是這位在牆上畫樹的警衛伯伯卻因為當時在寒冷的戶外畫畫，之

後卻凍死。」（C-09-012）

說完故事後，小美表示：

「想起了爺爺，並且發現自己以前只要是看到老人過世的電影或是橋段，都

會哭得很難過，讓小美想起爺爺對於自己的重要性，他是對自己最好的人。

另外小美也表示這個童話另一個想起的人是爸爸，對於爸爸也有很大的牽

掛，但是因為兩個人都很壓抑自己的情緒，根本無法表達愛、喜歡、難過或

生氣的情緒，所以如果發生口角時也會發現似乎彼此心中有極大的誤會。」

（C-09-014）

這也是促成研究者安排日後父女會談的動機。談即此，小美漸漸會說要珍惜這類的

話，並且也不捨家人為自己擔心，小美再次掉下眼淚的表示這兩個故事都是在談感情，

研究者也有共感，似乎這兩個故事也是在講小美與家人濃得化不開的情感，也因為濃烈

因此過去也是讓小美覺得痛苦及無法自處的問題根源，透過一次又一次的諮商，如同歷

經故事中死亡到重生的過程，舊我要死，新我才會成長的歷程，使得小美越來越能面對

自己。

四、簡式健康性格量表前後測結果

透過諮商中個案所呈現簡式健康量表前後測中，感覺憂鬱心情低落及有自殺想法兩

項分數，均從非常嚴重 4 分降為輕微程度 1 分及沒有自殺意念；其總分則由須轉介精神

科 19 分降為輕度情緒困擾 7 分。

147

參、討論與結論

一、結論

（一）個案在治療中呈現的五大主題

在治療過程中，個案的主題自然地一層又一層的顯露出來（Ray, 2011/2014），有出

現重複性的主題，這通常是象徵個案所遇到且正在處理的議題、經驗及內在衝突

（Giordano, & Landreth, 2008/2005）；並且可以根據主題重複性、強烈的程度以及具脈

絡性的特徵（Ray, 2016）整理出以下五大主題：

1.  權力／控制（次數：1、3）

這主題隱含著個案從小承受著家庭中暴力及壓力的對待，因為父權主義充斥而迫使

個案不得不的努力，當個案達不到媽媽的標準時，則是被打被羞辱，例如：「直到搬至

爸爸家同住後，曾經在一次與爸爸在賣場結帳時與媽媽相遇，我仍不敢直視媽媽，害怕

媽媽會再責罵只敢躲在爸爸身後偷偷看著媽媽。」（C-01-015）以及個案在初始沙盤中

的兩個家的議題，其中父親的家有許多軍事的交通工具，似乎也象徵具有強大的財富或

控制力；而巫婆的家有許多怪獸守護一樣，母親是以較原始的本能對待小美，小美也承

襲了這樣的本能，同時卻要壓抑自己的本能與母親互動，長期相處下來則出現自我懷疑

存在的意義。例如：「媽媽情緒暴躁，平常關心小美也對於生活及學業(cid:1291)就表現要求甚

高，不如媽媽的心意就被肢體或是言語暴力對待。」（C-03-009）這些內容均說明了個

案自幼在媽媽的權力/控制下成長，身為獨身女的個案也承受家人望子成龍，望女成鳳的

家(cid:13687)傳統想法的期待。

2.  離別的哀傷與不捨（次數：1、6、8）

這個主題則是可以看見個案在面對離別的價值觀，大多時候個案是較負面且悲傷的

狀態，在成年後的生活中個案經常會有生無可戀的想法，個案自覺達不到自身要求或不

如人時崩潰痛哭，甚至覺得活著是家人的負擔或是累贅而出現想要離世的想法，個案被

這樣的想法盤(cid:13683)在腦海。

例如個案在夢的解析中，看見惡夢所帶來的負向情緒所描述的內容：「夢中有一位

婦人到祠堂要拜拜求平安，因為身為軍職的先生已不在身邊多日且不知何去何從。」以

及「祠堂中池塘的水裡躺著一個裸露的男屍，這個男屍就正是那位婦人的先生，小美表

示在夢中很擔心婦人會受不了打擊而崩潰大哭。」（C-06-004）

研究者發現個案在夢的描述上與家人之間有很深的情感與感觸，從夢境中婦人先生

的不告而別想起自己過去同樣的行為模式，因此繼續邀請個案分享從小到大印象較深刻

的童話故事，從一對愛著對方的窮夫妻互贈聖誕禮物的故事：「雙方都是願意賣掉自己

148

最珍貴的東西後，將得到的金錢去買東西送給對方，都有一顆想要給對方最好的心。」

（C-09-002）這故事同時也看見個案犧牲的議題，個案總是先希望自己可以滿足家人的

期待，至於自己想要的生活似乎總是犧牲或是不去提及。

另一個最後一片葉子的童話故事，則是讓個案想起了爺爺，這時又再次看見個案對

於與家人的離別，例如：「想起了爺爺，讓小美想起爺爺對於自己的重要性，他是對自

己最好的人。另外小美也表示這個童話另一個想起的人是爸爸，對於爸爸也有很大的牽

掛。」（C-09-014），這些情緒的展露，剛好是個案過去所壓抑的，透過這樣的內容更

看見個案心中對於離別的不捨，這樣的主題也成為治療中重要的關鍵因素之一。

3.  分裂與連結（次數：  3、5、8、10、11-13）

個案年幼即面臨父母離異後單親的生活，一開始與媽媽同住 15 年，之後又因為升

學至爸爸家住，至今已 10 幾年，但是心中對於媽媽的害怕似乎沒有減少。而生活中這

樣的轉換，出現了個案心中分裂的情景，這同樣的在沙盤治療中顯現出來，沙盤分成 5

個部分，彼此之間出現連結，例如:  「兔子先生透過潛水員不斷與其他動物們的溝通，

並且目前動物們相處的情形是和平共存。」（C-03-012）這樣的內容也看見個案現實生

活，在家中個案為獨生女的情況下又需要承受來自家庭文化需要傳宗接代及光宗耀祖的

壓力，而盡孝道的觀念更督促小美在成年之後需要在凝聚家(cid:13687)情感上扮演重要的角色。

然而也看到連結的正向意義，例如：「小美也表示在沙盤中的家裡有隻最喜歡的小鱷魚

是巫婆送的，雙方認識也希望可以保持友好的關係。」（C-03-009）因此，個案如何透

過這樣的過程中善用自己的連結，而不是成為壓力，這也是治療中重要的轉變。

4.  安全感與自由的彈性（次數：6、10、11-13）

這個主題看見個案尋求安全感的來源，包括有靈性的部分，例如：「夢中有一位婦

人到祠堂要拜拜求平安。」（C-06-004）以及爸爸所提供的穩定生活，例如：「小美表

示現實中的爸爸做決策很有魄力，並且平常也沒有看到甚麼情緒的反應，爸爸在工作中

有很優秀的表現。」（C-03-009），在個案沙盤治療中呈現父親的家有食物的提供可以

滋養個案，另外也看見有許多軍事的交通工具，似乎與父親身為科技業或是有紀律有極

大的關係，同時也象徵具有強大的財富。

另外，個案在獲取安全感同時也出現了自由的彈性空間，例如：「沒想到這位婦人

看到屍體後並沒有哭，反而踹了那屍體一腳，我在驚訝之餘也笑了出來，之後夢就醒了。」

（C-06-004）夢境透露出來與個案現實生活反應相反的潛意識內容，這樣的發現讓個案

又驚又喜，更看見自己自由的彈性出現。另外個案在現實生活中，開始學汽車駕照考試

以及準備研究所進修。

5.  滋養與撫育（次數：5、6、8、10）

從第 4 點可以看見個案從父親的互動中得到安全感，同時被滋養及撫育，在超越功

能的部分也看見個案自己也出現滋養他人的能力及願意分享，例如：「自己喜歡吃甜點，

149

所以覺得象徵自己喜歡的小飛鼠可以跟不喜歡的黑老鼠一起吃。」（C-05-005）以及個

案的夢境：「夢中有一位婦人帶著兩個小孩，小孩是幼童一男一女。」（C-06-004），

儘管婦人內心對於先生下落不明有所不安，仍是帶著孩子一同尋求內心平安，這也看出

了個案就算是內心焦慮，但是因為責任感的驅使下，仍會盡可能做到家(cid:13687)中的要求，至

於內心的平靜，則會使用靈性的力量去幫助自己。

從上述的內容中可以整理出個案治療中出現的五個重要主題，其中對個案較有壓力

或是較易出現負面情緒的有：權力／控制、離別與哀傷、分化與連結；而安全感與自由

以及滋養與撫育則是讓個案覺得較為舒心且自在的部分。

（二）個案的自我發展及轉化

個案為年輕單身女性，因罹患重度憂鬱症，過去有自傷行為及自殺的意念且至身心

科就診。而成年初期女性在父母關係失和、親職功能處於不穩定的狀態，再加上本研究

中的個案在家中為獨生女，並沒有其他手足可以分擔家庭照顧的壓力下，對於身心也造

成了重大的影響。如黃宗堅等（2010）提及此狀況下易產生個體敏感他人需求及評價、

忽略自身情緒照顧、以犧牲換取被看見的機會與位置、感受關係中的不公平及被虧待以

及追求成就與渴望被關注的自我等面向。這些傾向在本研究中個案的身上可以看到之外，

也可以看到個案工具性或是成為情緒配偶的現象；個案在 15 歲前與母親一起生活的那

段日子，除了要在學業上達成母親的高壓及高期待，一方面也要陪伴母親在單親後的情

緒調節，因此，個案在自我情緒調節能力仍在發展的狀況下，承擔了超過自己可以承擔

的情緒壓力，甚至也學習到燥狂的情緒處理方式。個案在 15 歲後與父親同住，而父親

嚴謹的性格以及過於理智化的處理方式，也讓個案在情緒的調節上覺得冷漠並且依附關

係上反而頓失依靠，讓個案覺得憂鬱，個案就在父母的關係及相處狀態忽冷忽熱的互動

下，個案也未能有良好的適應造成身心的傷害。

因此個案在本研究中透過榮格取向之表達性藝術治療，深刻了解自己罹患重鬱症問

題與家庭關係中愛與要求間矛盾的情感，是如何影響自我的發展及親子關係，造成過去

的惡性循環。本研究中更協助個案辨識家庭文化影響，過去所承受本土文化中盡孝觀念

之影響以及家庭文化在重要凝聚家人情感上所扮演的角色，更可以貼近個案長期的憂鬱

情緒及壓力來源，本研究顯示榮格取向之遊戲治療對於嚴重情緒困擾之個案有明顯的療

效，在個案的困境中提供涵容的空間，使得個案內在兩極對立以及陰影逐漸整合，在轉

化經驗中個案產生存在感及意義感，對於曾經想以死來解脫人生困境的個案而言，頗有

死後重生的意境。在諮商歷程中也可以感受到個案所承受本土文化中盡孝觀念之影響以

及家庭文化在重要凝聚家人情感上所扮演的角色，更可以貼近個案的憂鬱情緒及壓力來

源，並且透過諮商的進行，個案學習取得平衡而非過與不及的愛，適當的安排加入親子

溝通會談的機會，如此之方式更有助於個案及案家多重的改變。

150

在現實生活中個案的確重新找到人生的目標及重心，打算至外地進修甚至出國移民

等事宜，並且在生活中從考上駕照及研究所開始實踐，也算是人生的再啟程，而這次不

再是為了父母或家庭的期待，而是著著實實的為自己開始活著。

（三）個案生活脈絡更新

個案已順利通過汽車駕照考試以及錄取研究所進修，更預計在未來研究所實習時申

請到國外，嚮往國外的生活環境，再加上目前心中大石已經放下，與家人間可以流暢的

表達心中想法與情緒，這次的治療可以說是疏通了過去個案心中的陰鬱，以及找不到出

路的無助，因此個案更表示未來也想在國外工作並定居，由此清楚可以看到個案的個體

化歷程也帶領自己走向一條康莊大道。這是一條通往自己內在需求，而非滿足他人需求

的道路。

二、討論

（一）在治療過程中連結自身與小美人魚象徵的關係—重新回到海裡

個案談到自己的英文名稱和小美人魚中主角一樣是「Ariel」，這個稱呼在西班牙文

化中是男性的名字，個案表示很喜歡小美人魚的故事，所以使用這個名字。而小美人魚

的故事在郭蕙寧和黃宗堅（2017）童話解析中提及小美人魚象徵阿尼瑪（Anima）的集

體潛意識原型，原名為海的女兒，和「海、水、魚和女性」有關。

依據榮格的原型觀點，水是女性能量——阿尼瑪潛意識最普遍的象徵，心靈中包含

著陰性和陽性等多種相互對立的元素，其整合與平衡過程即為個體化歷程（Jung,

1969/1980）；而此時此刻正也是個案在經歷的。個案從自己的英文名字與小美人魚名字

相同為起點，經歷許多陰陽對立以及內在母性情結的對立、人格面具與陰影面之整合，

如同 Jung（1995）表示其過程也就是與對立面的整合，也就是小美人魚重新回到海裡的

過程，這些也都是小美在轉化經驗中所不斷經歷的。

（二）頓悟離苦得樂之道——從憂鬱自我封閉轉化為靈活彈性應變

個案在超越功能體驗中曾經選討厭的黑老鼠來代表媽媽在小美心中負向的感受，並

選擇馬桶來當作超越功能的第三方。Von  Franz（1970/2018）曾提及在英雄之(cid:13677)中英雄

若是被怪獸吞入肚子代表沒有出路，而在本研究中個案將超越功能選擇用馬桶來象徵，

也像是被馬桶沖下去之物也沒有再出現過一般，將黑老鼠如同個案心中的陰影，在面對

內在黑暗暴力的陰影，最終吞噬轉化並整合來療癒自己的創傷，就研究者觀察，個案也

是在這樣的超越三物件之後進入夢的解析，同時也可以發現個案情緒越來越朝向整合的

方向進行（Johnson, 1991/2021）。另外在游立宇等人（2021）的研究中也提及華人組織

151

中的人際壓力之因應，可以分成忍耐維和、認知調適及消極退避，個案可以說是從忍耐

維和或消極退避的型態，因為對於自己的了解與接納逐漸走向認知調適。

鄭思維（Cheng, 2003）針對人們因應事情的彈性（coping flexibility），在面對壓力

事件時，有分辨並採取行動的能力，能達到較好的心理健康適應。在本研究中，個案逐

漸可以辨識家庭文化對於自身的影響後，於夢的解析時可以看見個案出現俏皮或是詼諧

的一面，同時也具有惡作劇者的原型，讓原本悲劇的故事內容變得趣味的處理能力，這

與過去個案總是負面思考、擔心結果，而從潛意識的體會中發現事情的發展並非像自己

所向的悲觀時，個案開啟了可以接受不同結果的可能性，如同個案自己內在的智慧老人

在教導個案自己，習得離苦得樂之道。個案帶著探索夢境的結果回到日常生活中，並且

去了解過去的自己因為一事無成而成為家人的累贅時，開始產生自我了斷的念頭；但是

也因為在這場夢境中，不告而別去從軍先生的死亡、婦人看見屍體後踹一腳的反應，似

乎意會到事情的發展不一定是像自己想得那樣不好或是悲觀時，也展露出了重生的笑容

及曙光，讓個案透過潛意識知道事情的結果不一定是負向的，對事情的看法也增加了彈

性及希望感，如同 Kalsched（2013/2022）提到，個體會找到勇氣來承受某些過往創傷痛

苦。在本研究中的確可以看見個案突破現況，進入自我接納更寬廣的境界，脫離了受害

或自責的樣態。因此也可以發現個案內在自我修復的力量，透過在夢境中自己與自己的

對話及發現，好像讓原本覺得又大又難的事情變得可以面對，個案的整體狀態明顯趨向

平穩且自在，情緒也較輕鬆，進而產生整合的能力。

（三）父女關係透過父親的獨白而冰釋

父女牽著手走進會談室，看起來爸爸對於個案相當在意。個案也可以從過去較反向

及負面的表達情緒方式，調整為較直接且正向的表達方式。在會談中個案說了很多與父

親相處的點滴，個案表示父親很喜歡爬山，所以過去父女會一起去爬山，父親也表示過

去的確會勉強個案運動，現在也學習尊重。

研究者也協助個案表達過去在意及誤會的部分，雙方透過說明及澄清更了解彼此，

也更可以知道未來的互動可以如何拿捏，父親過去總是呈現嚴肅的一面，在會談中也自

然展現出嚴父及慈母一體的形象。在會談中父親的一段獨白可以說是父女關係破冰的關

鍵：

「自從小美 15 歲後跟我同住，因為長期我都(cid:1286)於工作也疏於與家人相處，

我一直不知如何與一位青春期的女兒互動，因此多半是處於不知所措且有

些惶恐的狀態。在公司裡我是 CEO，同事的確都聽命於我，但是下班後我卻

是會請幾位有女兒的男同事留下來，我想要知道的是一位父親該如何養育

一位青少年時期的女兒，換我跟同事請教，因為我想要當一個好父親，也希

望父女關係可以漸漸變好。」(F-10-010)

152

此時在一(cid:13673)聽到父親獨白的小美，頓時淚崩，聽見了父親的無助以及想要改變關係

的努力，同時也向父親擁抱表示感謝。父女倆在此時經歷了關係冰釋的神聖時刻，這一

分一秒是這樣的珍貴，而真情流露在兩人之間，研究者也為之動容。這讓研究者也不禁

想起，小美在沙遊治療初始沙盤中第一個所放的橋樑物件，其象徵的溝通功能（Matthews,

1993）似乎在此刻發揮了效用，並同時呼應了 Kalsched（2013/2022）提及早年創傷的個

案會陳述充滿超自然存在體的內在世界「拯救」了他們，那個世界會為他們自身純真的

靈魂提供一處原型涵容的處所。而現在，小美不必透過內在世界想像，而是在現實生活

中真實的體現了被拯救的力量。透過父女的親子會談，的確也可以達到相互溝通表達想

法的效果，而研究者的在場可以說是親子雙方的見證，同樣也是發揮橋樑及溝通的角色。

會談中更說明了親子過去因為沒有良好的表達機會與方式，採用較為單向的溝通處

理模式，而且大多是父親的一廂情願以及個案的痛哭抗拒，往往也是造成雙方誤會的地

方，目前可以透過會談來達成雙方溝通的機會，相信這次只是開端，未來仍是需要持續

的溝通方能增進雙方的了解及體諒。

（四）從對客體關係的了解中再次驗證

Winnicott（1960）將母親與嬰兒形容成心身相伴的關係，Kalsched（2013/2022）也

曾引述 Winnicott 所提及母嬰關係二原體的神聖意象，就更可以說明性與親密感之關聯。

因此從母親與嬰兒之間的身體接觸之親密，進而形成嬰兒的內心世界，心身相伴的過程

進而影響日後個體建立親密關係的方法，在本研究中的個案在母嬰關係上缺乏愛的照顧。

Kalsched  （1996/2018）引用 Winnicott 提及如果母親的照顧是變動無常、大幅刺激，又

或是經常忽略，個體身上真我就會分裂出假我，目的是早熟的將真我與創傷隔絕。本研

究中的個案就是這樣的變動環境下成長，個案會出現假我來保護自我，甚至也惡化成身

心症狀。本研究中個案處於重鬱症的精神狀態，Kalsched（2013/2022）更提到憂鬱症吸

吮著個體，讓個體覺得心情已經不再屬於自己，而是屬於憂鬱症。因此在本研究中，個

案亦將自己對於真實或幻想的母親愛恨的感受投射至研究者身上，研究者接收及調整這

樣的投射，個案因而透過調整變得較緩和，並且研究者透過重新引入愛的感覺與個案間

形成轉化的關係，個案出現良知進而修復與母親之間的陳年傷害，過程也就如此來來回

回的進展。

（五）研究限制與未來展望

本研究之個案透過榮格心理分析取向之遊戲治療的方式被承接及涵容，對於過去的

創傷轉化為祝福，產生修復的能力。在新的(cid:13677)程，放下以往抑鬱的內心狀態，取而代之

的是願意迎向開放性的歷程，當個案產生自身的存在感及意義感後，能夠重新出發去尋

153

找新的希望人生目標。然而研究者也發現，不是每位個案都能夠說出自己印象深刻的童

話故事，或是如本研究對象覺察力敏銳，能夠在諮商後期自我剖析，因此建議未來可以

開展如繪畫、心理演劇等催化及輔助的方式，將內在的想法或是情境表達出來，如此也

可以幫助個案體驗自身的感受，並且從創傷中釋放。（本論文部分內容曾發表於 2022 年

On Freedom from Suffering: A Jungian Expressive Art Therapy Analysis
of A Major Depressive Indigenous Woman

Jung-Jung Li*      Tsung-Chain Huang      Fang-Ting Chang

Abstract

The purpose of this study is to understand and portray the individualization process through

Jungian expressive art therapy of a female clinical client suffering from major depression and

suicidal ideation. Thematic analysis was methodically adopted, using primarily qualitative and

partially  quantitative  Jungian  analysis  on  sandtray  therapy,  dream,  and  fairy  tales.  The

researcher and the client completed 12 individual sessions and one father-and-daughter family

therapy session, additional references include doctor’s referral notes, family interview records,

and 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) pre-therapy and post-therapy scores. Results

have shown the shadow from the client’s childhood chronic parental conflicts overshadowed

the client’s ego, throwing the client in constant self-doubt, existential crisis, and lack of self-

worth. Sandtray therapy revealed an adversarial polarization and black or white binary thinking

pattern drew others away yet concealing the wishes to be understand and accepted by others.

The three transcendental objects  reflect  the overabundant  melancholy  gradually transformed

into a glorious unity. Dream analysis unveiled cognitive fixation and hopeless thoughts were

transmittable  into  flexibility  and  alternative  resolutions.  The  selection  and  analysis  of  the

client’s fairy tales disclosed a projection of deep bounding toward family, especially when the

client has chosen “The last leaf” story, which divulges her symbolic rebirth after the deathlike

experience of mental termination. Finally the father- and- daughter therapeutic session was a

groundbreaking move that  established a rebinding  and deep-seated bound. furthermore, five

themes were merged, which were power and control, separation and sorrow, individualization

and connection, safety and freedom, and nourishment and nurturing. The pre- and post-test of

BSRS-5 total score decreased from 15 points to 9 points, with the depressive mood changing

from 4 to 2, and ideation score changing from 4 to 0, indicating a severe distress turning into a

mild distress after the therapy. In conclusion, this study implies significant therapeutic effect of

Jungian expressive art therapy sessions on a client suffering from severe mood disturbances

and suicidal ideation. The containing capacity in the expressive art therapy enabled the client

159

to transform and integrate through black or white dichotomy and shadows from the past ; within

the individualization process, personal meaning and existence were propagated and outgrew,

symbolizing a reborn after the mental death, a restart on the life journey, and a revitalization of

goal, priorities and modalities. During the counseling process, filial piety was an influential yet

implicit  indigenous  obligation  on  the  client’s  well-being,  that  often  depleted  her  mental

resources. She bore the indigenous culture values of family cohesion and duties as a daughter

to  take emotional care of both  sides of the parents.  Instead of shutting down the filial piety

concerns, a familial therapeutic session was adopted, which facilitated the communication with

her father enhanced multifaced changes, both individually and systematically. She adjusted to

a more direct and positive communicative tone, and her father expressed in a more respectful

and benevolent manner in return, their conjoint session dispelled the long-term impasse, and

the researcher was the bridge to their communication, and honored to witness her resilience on

individualization.

  I. Preface

This  study  explores  and  understands  the  traumatic  life  experience  of  a  case  from  an

indigenous psychological perspective in childhood due to a discord between parents, and suffers

from major depression. Through the case description, we can understand the case's growing up

in a traditional family with local cultural colors. Nasir et al. (2021) mentioned in the study that

the treatment model for depression must understand concepts such as culture, personal identity,

and  happiness.  In  addition,  therapeutic  approaches  need  to  integrate  social  and  emotional

concepts. As mentioned by Jung (2013/1964), the collective subconscious is a cultural symbol

used to express eternal truths. After a long transformation, it has become a collective image

accepted by civilized society. From this study, we can also see that the collective subconscious

significantly impacts  individual  cases.  In  addition,  the case had a  tremendous psychological

impact after the parents divorced. As the case continues to bear the pressure from family culture

and  the  process  of  re-living  in  adulthood,  the  researcher  tried  to  use  Jungian  expressive  art

therapy to intervene in the case's transformation experience. Through discussion, I see that the

case is well accepted, and I am also willing to use this method to explore my subconscious mind

more deeply. Mehl-Madrona and Mainguy (2021) also mentioned that culture is affected by the

collectivist  mentality,  and  the  group's  needs  replace  individual  needs,  so  treatment  methods

need to consider local culture and spirituality.

The  researchers  discussed  the  relevant  literature  and  found  out  that  the  adjustment  of

couples to divorce needs to be considered from a process perspective, including stress, risk, and

resilience, which is an excellent pressure for both adults and children (Irene et al., 2017/2019).

A survey and statistical analysis by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that the number

of divorced women aged 15-64 in my country increased by more than 20% at the end of the

1990s compared with the previous survey in the 1990s (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2015).

In response to the current attitude towards life, single parents mainly focus on "working hard

to maintain the family income" and "focusing on taking care of their children."; regarding their

feelings after becoming  a single parent,  they believe that  "there is  greater work or  financial

pressure" and "worry about themselves or their children's future." and "Better relationship with

children," it is evident that after single-parent families, economic problems and problems with

children have become the focus of single parents' lives. After becoming a single-parent family,

38.29% of children have negative impacts on their children's mental health, and 28.25% have

negative  implications  for  their  children's  character  and  behavior  (Ministry  of  Health  and

Welfare, 2010).  From this,  we  can see the impact  of the disintegration of the family on the

161

individual's  growth  process.  Therefore,  this  study  uses  Jungian  expressive  art  therapy  to

intervene in casework, trying to understand and help individuals in single-parent families or

divorced parents with poor relationships. The purpose of studying the impact of situations on

individuals, and even the changes in emotional behavior in adulthood, is to promote a better

understanding among the Chinese people of the social and psychological pressures faced by

adults who grew up in local single-parent families, as they readjust to culture, society, and other

aspects of life. The process of individualization of individual cases is  an admirable learning

experience.

1. Exploring Individual Cases of Depression from Indigenous Psychology

First,  let’s  understand  what  indigenous  psychology  is.  According  to  Yang  (2005),  the

definition is as follows: Indigenous psychology is a psychological knowledge system that uses

scientific  methods  to  study  the  psychological  and  behavioral  development  of  people  in  a

specific ethnic group or social culture, but the theory used in the research process, concepts,

methods,  and  tools  must  be  highly  consistent  with  the  local  psychological  or  behavioral

phenomenon  being  discussed  and  its  ecological,  economic,  social,  cultural  and  historical

context.

From Yang's (2005) definition, it is not difficult to understand that indigenous psychology

is a method that can be used to understand the psychology and behavior of local people. Viewed

from this context, the issues of individual cases can be said to have a close relationship to the

environment in which the individual lives. Yang (1993) mentioned that the social orientation

characteristics of Chinese people include four types: family orientation, relationship orientation,

authority  orientation,  and  other  orientation.  Among  them,  family  orientation  symbolizes  the

supremacy of authority and values family harmony, unity, wealth, and honor. And authority

sensitivity is inseparable from relationship orientation. In addition, Chang (1989) mentioned

that  the  ultimate  goal  of  Confucian  ethics  is  the  concept  of  "harmony,"  and  Hwang  (1995)

constructed a "theoretical model of face and faver" from Chinese Confucianism.

On the one hand, the Chinese consolidated his authoritative position and, on the other hand,

emphasized the honor of his ancestors. Hsu and Yeh (2019) further explained that the cultural

tone of Chinese society is collective and relationalism, and the particular emphasis on group

and relational characteristics has a profound impact on the psychology and behavior of Chinese

people. Yeh et al. (2006) believe that family culture refers to some values, beliefs, and norms

passed down by the family and shared among members (relationship structure). In addition,

162

attention is paid to centripetal, a sense of unity, and the division of internal and external lines.

The communication and interaction modes include exchanging messages, poor expression of

emotions,  etc.  It  can  be  seen  from  the  literature  that  Chinese  value  beliefs  may  also  have  a

diversionary effect between ethnic groups.

The client was born in the 21st century, and there is a generational gap between the views

of  her  parents  and  grandparents.  In  addition,  the  client  has  learned  foreign  languages  since

childhood, and her studies were mainly in the environment of foreign language departments.

Therefore, the client itself has also appeared to be seriously westernized. From the literature

and the client's background information, we can see that the client is in a Chinese family. As

the only daughter in a single-parent family, the impact of the family and relationships on the

client can be assessed based on the degree of close contact between the client and her family,

It is not difficult to understand that the emotions, concepts, and character development of the

client are inextricably linked to the family. The physical and mental symptoms of significant

depression caused by having no siblings to share or share such stressful situations make the

case even more helpless in this situation. In this situation, maybe client deeply feel that "death"

may be a relief from facing difficulties.

In  Chinese  culture,  it  can  also  be  seen  that  the  rights  of  those  in  authority  under  the

patriarchal system are indeed a source of security for the individual. Still, they are also a source

of  responsibility  and  pressure  to  focus  on  face  and  peace,  as  well  as  the  importance  of  the

individual to the family. Struggling to strike a balance is a complex subject. As Jung's alchemy

furnace  emphasizes,  the  integration  of  individuals  and  ethnic  groups  and  the  integration  of

China and the West are the arduous processes of adjustment and adaptation the cases in this

study must face.

The empathy aroused by the researcher's contact and understanding became the current

supporting force of the case. The researcher and the case lived in the same cultural background

and era and became the person who could understand the phenomenon described by the case.

The case suddenly felt that she was not alone., can also expand and influence other areas of life

due to such support, which can be said to be from "problem point" to "involved level" to "real

phenomenon field." Therefore, the changes caused after treatment intervention also require a

treatment room. Analyze and compare the situation in the game with real life.

2. Self-Development of Local Women

163

Yang (1991)  first  proposed that the self-development process  of Chinese people under

Confucian culture is mainly formed gradually through the internalization of moral standards

and social norms. Markus and Kitayama (1991) proposed self-construal theory, which can be

divided into two types: "Interdependent self-construal" and "Independent self-construal." He et

al. (1991) suggested that, under the framework of relational orientation, the Chinese self can be

said to be relational, and individuals cannot be distinguished from others. The Chinese develop

an interdependent and inclusive self-based social orientation and a prototype concept of self-

realization. Lu (2003) mentioned that modern Chinese society has created an "eclectic self" that

includes  the traditional Chinese "interdependent and tolerant  self" and the "independent  and

self-sufficient self" of Western culture. In addition to research on the Chinese self, Yang (2004)

mentioned that the construction of the Chinese self is based on the conceptual framework of

personal and social orientation. Lu and Yang (2005) organized Western culture as an archetypal

concept of personal orientation and self-realization based on developing an independent self.

As for the discussion of self-development and relationships among Chinese people, Chen

(1995)  mentioned  in  a  study  of  the  psychological-emotional  conflict  and  change  process

between college girls and their parents that while the cases were seeking autonomy internally,

they also experienced the feeling of guilt about leaving their parents. Lo (1997) also pointed

out  the  pressure  that  domestic  adolescents  bear  in  parent-child  relationships  to  repay  their

parents' kindness. Liu (1998) further discussed that adolescent girls are less likely to adopt the

separation  mode  when  separating  and  reuniting  with  their  mothers.  Josselson  (1980)  also

reminded us that the divided self does not mean loneliness but becomes oneself in relationships.

The researcher realized that in the self-development of Chinese people, it is tough for girls to

use the separation model to become independent. They often have a contradiction of wanting

to maintain themselves and wanting to maintain relationships. Therefore, in the transformation

process, they can only use awareness and expression to partially satisfy the self they wish to

form. Hsu et al. (2020) further revealed that the interaction between obligations and rights under

the  obligation  orientation  and  relationalism  in  the  Chinese  parent-child  relationship  is  only

about fulfilling obligations and not seeking to enjoy rights.

From this, we can also see that the cases in this study face the dilemma of independence

and gender role expectations related to taking care of the family in traditional filial piety. In

addition, their family members may affirm or encourage the cases when they self-sacrifice and

take care of the family in return, which is more likely to cause conflicts in the client's mind and

is also an issue that local women often encounter in their self-development. Moral standards

and social norms regulate the Chinese self and derive from self-cultivation. The cases in this

164

study have also developed traits that are pretty sensitive to introspection or self-criticism, and

there are substantial differences in the performance of the public and private selves. There will

inevitably be contradictions or conflicts.

3. The Psychosomatic Disorder of the Case - Major Depression

The latest fifth edition of the American Classification and Diagnostic Criteria of Mental

Disorders from the American Psychiatric Association (APA) (2013/2014) mentions that five or

more of the nine items within at least two weeks are considered a major depressive episode.

The problems included in the cases in this study include depression, which occurs almost all

day and every day—a significant decrease in all or nearly all activities, interests, or pleasures.

I  suffer  from  insomnia  every  day  and  feel  tired  and  lose  energy.  Almost  daily  feelings  of

worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt decreased ability to think or concentrate, or

inability to make decisions, and repeated thoughts of death and previous suicide attempts or

unique plans to commit suicide.

In  addition,  some  cases  also  reported  frequent  nightmares.  The  correlation  between

nightmares  and  physical  and  mental  symptoms  in  domestic  and  foreign  literature  includes

nightmares  and  sleep  disorders,  psychological  distress,  depression,  neurotic  traits,  post-

traumatic  stress  disorder,  and  anxiety  symptoms  (Bolstad  et  al  .,  2021;  Dassel  et  al.,  2018;

Martina  &  Reinhard,  2001);  and  nightmare  distress,  frequency,  and  repetitiveness  are  also

associated  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  symptoms  (Dassel  et  al.,  2018)  and

suicide ( Shianne et al., 2020). In addition, nightmares are related to personal real-life problems

or personal traits and emotions: physical discomfort caused by nightmares is also considered to

be a problem in their lives and urges them to solve personal issues (Martin & Reinhard, 2001);

and  individual  ego  strength  may  partially  explain  the  association  with  nightmares,  neurotic

traits, and states of psychological distress (William, 2020). Weinstein et al. (2017) found the

relationship  between  daily  life  in  a  study.  They  repeated  dreams  that  frustration  in  life

experiences  has  an  essential  impact  on  triggering  negative  emotions  in  dreams.  People  who

often suffer from nightmares are harmful and have more negative emotions than people who do

not experience nightmares (Franc et al., 2021). Finally, in the treatment of nightmares, cognitive

behavioral therapy can increase control over the content of dreams and reduce post-traumatic

nightmare distress (Harb et al., 2016). Studies have proven that cognitive behavioral therapy is

practical and effective in patients with bipolar disorder (Miller et al., 2018). There is also using

cognitive behavioral therapy to deal with insomnia combined with sleepwalking (Wung & Yeh,

165

2013).  Logotherapy  and  solution-focused  short-term  therapy  help  dreamers  respond  more

competently and less fearfully after waking up from dreams and positively impact functioning

(Ellis, 2016).

Therefore, the treatment of cases in this study also includes the treatment of nightmares.

Since nightmares are abstract and cause negative emotions in these cases, expressive art therapy

can be achieved through sandtray objects. The use of clay creation or fairy tale narrations that

are deeply impressed in the client's mind can help the client to reveal the inner subconscious

part and help the client to realize and identify. Furthermore, the case is also being exposed to

various media and can express and release more emotions that have been suppressed in the heart

for a long time. In the process of contact with the subconscious mind, the case has also increased

the  ability  to  view  its  problems  from  multiple  perspectives,  and  no  longer  from  a  single

perspective,  therapeutic  intervention  helps  the  client's  thinking  become  more  flexible  and

loosen the possibility of fixing hopeless thoughts.

4. Jungian Expressive Art Therapy

The content of Jungian-oriented expressive art therapy used in this study includes sandtray

therapy, clay creation with dream interpretation, fairy tale analysis, etc., which are all part of

the intervention using expressive art therapy with multiple media. Jung (1961) also said that

expressing the inner world through artistic media can help people integrate their inner and outer

beings. Art itself can heal, allow the repressed subconscious to be visualized and raised to the

level of consciousness, and capture the prototypes in the subconscious and transform them into

symbolic images  (Hsu, 2021).  Images can also  impregnate symbols and  make images alive.

(Nora,  2018/2022),  schematic  images  in  artistic  creation  are  regarded  as  life  in  pictures

(Schaverien, 1992). The descriptions of various intervention contents are as follows:

(1) Sandtray Therapy and Transcendental Functions

This therapy provides a free and protected space (Kalff, 1980) in which clients can express

and experience emotions arising from early trauma, abandonment, or deprivation; the free and

protective relationship established is like that of a mother to her child. Love is an indispensable

and important factor in healing and transformation (Kalff, 1980). Weinrib (2004) observes that

the dynamics of the sandtray's function are very similar to the transference methods used by

what  Winnicott  calls  "transitional  objects".  Huang  (2005)  believed  that  the  client's  hand

touching the sand produced a "kinesthetic experience" that caused the focus of attention to shift

166

from the outside to the inside. The sand play objects attracted the client because they aroused

the client's suppressed psychic elements and presented them. Come out, and the therapist creates

a safe space and connects to things of personal significance through words, sandtray recordings,

and case discussions. Mitchell and Friedman (2003) proposed that the following phenomena

can be observed in the sandtray: the energy points and trouble points of the case, what types of

phenomenon clusters appear, the power or resources presented, and what symbols of trauma

are presented in the sandtray. Based on the above content, it can be understood that the process

of sandtray therapy can provide a safe and tolerant environment, helping individuals to move

from the external world to the internal world for repair. Therefore, in this study, it can be used

as an introduction point for consultation, and on a case-by-case basis for self-injury and suicide

issues that are difficult to explain or are complex, we provide methods to promote feelings or

issues that cannot be touched by talk therapy, and can achieve the effects of expression and

transformation.

The transcendent function is a psychological function produced by combining conscious

and  unconscious  content  (Jung  1916/2014).  The  transcendent  function  must  first  have

unconscious  material,  usually  using  the  content  of  dreams  or  spontaneous  fantasies  (Jung,

1964/2013). For adults, complete self-sufficiency can only be achieved through integrating the

conscious and subconscious mind. Jung believed that the mind transcends functions and allows

the individual's potential to be fully  realized (Jung, 1916/2014). Kalsched (2013/2022) talks

about the importance of the transcendent function. This space between our private subjectivity

and intersubjectivity is to heal what we find unbearable and escape from one world to another.

(2) Jungian Dream Interpretation

a. The Meaning of Dream Interpretation

Jung once mentioned that the symbols of dreams cannot be treated separately from the

context of the dreamer but must be considered by the causes and consequences of the dream

itself (Jung, 1964/2013). Huang (2007) mentioned Jung's concept of the collective unconscious

in dream interpretation and emphasized that its principles lie in intuition and individualized,

flexible attitudes. Therefore, researchers believe that exploring and analyzing dreams is a vital

medium to build a bridge between the self and subconscious content, helping patients explore

their souls and awaken or find direction and strength from difficult experiences.

b. Stage of dream interpretation

167

Johnson  (1986)  used  Jungian  theory  as  the  basic  structure  and  divided  the  dream

interpretation  process  into  four  stages,  namely  association,  psychodynamic  exploration,

interpretation, and ritualization.

(a) Association - Active Imagination and Expansion

Johnson (1986) mentioned that for any symbol in a dream, the subconscious mind is ready

to find its meaning and metaphor through association. The content can be divided into "active

imagination"  and  "amplification."  ).  Huang  (2007)  mentioned  that  active  imagination  is  a

technique used by Jung to deepen the meaning of dreams in her dream interpretation work, and

expansion is the imagistic expansion and extension of the archetypes and images in dreams.

Kalsched (2013/2022) mentioned that the expansion method is a technique used by Jung when

facing the collective material of dreams, gathering word associations, myths, religious images,

etc. Active imagination is also an essential method in Jungian theory (Shen, 2004). The point

of active imagination is to allow unconscious fantasies to flow into the selfless vacuum and

integrate into daily life (Tibaldi, 2010/2017).

      (b) Exploration of Psychological Dynamics

The primary purpose is to find out the events between dreams and the dreamer’s inner

emotions, the activation of inner personality, feelings, attitudes, values or moods, etc.

  (c)Interpretation

This part focuses on the core message and advice given by the dream, so the dreamer must

approve any interpretation. Huang (2016) mentioned that reconciliation and integration may

gain new interpretations in the face of complex issues. Then, one can experience the actual state

of existence among all things and the genuine compassion for people.

      (d) Ritualization

This part is mainly for the dreamer to return to daily life with the results of dream

exploration so that the dreamer can understand the connection with himself and help the

dreamer experience more spiritual awakening or find new ideas from troubled experiences.

      (3) Jungian Fairy Tale Therapy

Von Franz (1970/2018) is the earliest advocate of Jungian fairy tale therapy. He believes

fairy tales present purer symbols and archetypes (Johnson, 1991/2021). Guo and Huang (2017)

stated  that  fairy  tales  contain  symbolic  language  that  can  express  the  spiritual  experience

accumulated by human beings over a long period. Kast (2004/1986) believes that fairy tales can

protect people's voices and inner desires, allowing people to see the plight of their lives in a

symbolic form.

168

Researchers try to use expressive arts therapy to provide a safe environment, use various

expressive media to help the client express their emotions or reveal the suffering of long-term

physical and mental symptoms, and support the client's transition from the external world to

the inner world and heal.

II. Research Methods

Research methods are divided into research questions and purposes, research design,

procedures and tools, rigor, ethics, and research participants.

1. Research Questions and Purposes

This  study  aims  to  understand  the  transformation  experience  of  a  woman  with  severe

depression  after  experiencing  childhood  trauma  through  the  intervention  of  expressive  art

therapy from the perspective of indigenous psychology. The contents of expressive art therapy

using Jungian psychoanalysis include sandtray therapy, dream analysis, and fairy tale metaphor

analysis. And the transformation experience will lead to a deeper understanding and application

of how to escape suffering and gain happiness.

2. Research Design

This study used thematic analysis to explore the connotation of treatment themes. This

method  processes  the  essential  patterns  in  the  research  data  and  discovers  their  connections

with the research questions (Braun & Clarke, 2006). As for the analysis steps, we refer to Kao's

(2008) point of view and use the following procedures to analyze the research data:

a. Write case records and collect relevant research data clearly and in detail so that the

research data can present the original phenomenon as much as possible.

b.  The  researcher  reads  the  text  repeatedly  with  an  open  attitude  and  writes  down  her

understanding and reflections.

c. During the research process, discover the context of events and visual frames, mark,

code, and annotate information related to the theme, and then gradually examine these meaning

units to facilitate the summary of future themes.

d. Gain an overall understanding of the text through repeated reading.

169

e. Analyze the structure of experience and reconstruct meaning or rediscover new units of

meaning.

f. Identify common themes and reflections, present and name essential themes.

This study attempts to use the theme of "power/control" as an example to illustrate the

coding process.

3. Recruit Participant (case/client) and Collect Information

When referring the client counseling part of this study to the researcher, the referring unit

has asked the client to fill in a counseling consent form, which thoroughly explains the parts of

the counseling process regarding audio and video recording, and the need to take photos of the

client's creation-work during treatment. Therefore, the researcher keeps records based on each

audio recording. After the treatment is completed and before writing the research content, the

researcher  explains  the  purpose  of  the  research  to  the  client,  the  data  collection  method,

confidentiality, and research ethics, and signs a consent form. The client's consent was again

obtained to participate in this study and to use the interview data.

4. Research Procedures and Tools

(1) Research Procedures

The researcher conducted treatment and audio recording with the client's consent, then

transcribed the verbatim manuscript and conducted text analysis. Based on the interpreted

understanding, the researcher began to write the research results and discussion. The

description of its text encoding is as follows:

1. The coding is divided into three paragraphs, representing [speaker]- [number of meetings]-

[conversation serial number] respectively.

2. R represents the researcher's serial number.

3. C represents the serial number of the research participant (case).

4. F represents the research participant's serial number (the case's father).

Example: C-01-001 represents the first sentence of the case said in the first interview. R-02-

002 represents the second sentence spoken by the researcher in the second interview.

  (2) Research Tools

Recording equipment used in the study, informed consent form. The main reason for using

audio recordings is that the audio files can present the actual content and sounds of the

interviews between the case and the researcher, analyze the case issues and experiences, and

explore related variables (Lin, 2017).

(3) Research Scale

171

Lee  et  al.  (2003)  developed  the  Short  Form  Health  Scale  as  a  self-report  scale,  which

includes a 5-question symptom question set to measure the severity of common psychological

distress such as anxiety, anger, depression, low self-esteem, and insomnia; and 1 question. The

purpose of suicide assessment is to screen for mental disorders and provide necessary mental

health services.

Each question in this scale is scored from 0 to 4 points, with 0 points: not at all, 1 point:

slight, 2 points: moderate, 3 points: strong, and 4 points: very strong. The total score is 0~20

points. When used, the best cutting point for distinguishing mental disorders is 6 points. The

total score (severity of symptoms or psychological distress) is divided into the following levels:

Total  score  for  questions  1  to  5,  Score:  0~5  indicates  good  physical  and  mental  adaptation.

Score: 6 to 9 indicates mild emotional distress and emotional support is recommended. Score:

10 to 14 is considered moderate emotional distress, and it is recommended to be referred for

psychiatric treatment or receive professional counseling. Score: greater than 15 is considered

severe emotional distress, and it is  recommended to  be referred  for psychiatric treatment  or

receive professional counseling. In addition, the single score of question 6 (whether there is

suicidal ideation) is an additional question. If the total score of the first five questions is less

than 6 points, but the score of this question is more than 2 points (moderate level), referral to a

psychiatric department should be considered.

Analysis of the reliability and validity of the Short-form Health Scale by different ethnic

groups shows that each scale has good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .77-.90). The test-

retest  reliability  is  .82,  which  is  consistent  with  the  spirit  of  the  Mini-International

Neuropsychological  Interview  schedule  comparing  the  disease  diagnosis  results,  using  six

points as the cut-off point of the scale can achieve a sensitivity of 78.9%, a specificity of 74.3%,

and a correct diagnosis rate of 76.3%.

5. Research Rigor

The treatment data used in this study come from the active treatment process of the case,

and the data have reliable sources. This study qualitatively analyzed the verbatim manuscript

of  case  therapy.  To  increase  the  reliability  of  the  research  data,  the  researcher  received

supervision  in  addition  to  the  professional  doctoral  course  in  counseling  and  counseling.

Through the supervisor, from an objective and experienced perspective, work together to help

review the information presented in the case. This study was verified through triangulation of

data sources and theory, as explained below:

172

(1) Triangulation of Data Sources

Research data collection also uses information from referral agencies, family members,

etc.,to cross-verify the accuracy of observation records. The researchers verified the text content

with individual cases to ensure that the content of the interviews was consistent with an average

of 90% to ensure that there were no misunderstandings or distortions in the interview content

  (2) Theoretical Triangulation Test

              This study also discussed and interpreted with reference to object relations theory, and

compared opinions with research collaborators during the text analysis process to reduce the

systematic  bias  of  the  data  and  improve  the  quality  and  credibility  of  the  content  analysis.

Finally, the researcher also mailed the results to the case to determine the content of the public

information and avoid infringement of privacy.

6. Research Ethics

              The researcher explained the study to the case and obtained consent forms. To ensure

the  rights  and  interests  of  the  client,  no  research-related  projects  were  initiated  during  the

treatment period. The purpose was to allow the researcher to conduct the treatment process in

a single capacity as a clinical psychologist and to accept clinical supervision to ensure that to

protect the client's rights and interests, all information that could identify the client's identity

was deleted during the research process.

7. Research Participants

(1) Researcher

The  researcher  (the  first  author)  is  a  clinical  psychologist  who  has  been  engaged  in

medical  and  educational  work  for  16  years  and  is  currently  studying  in  the  Department  of

Guidance and Counseling doctoral program and receiving supervision. The researcher has also

taken courses related to counseling theory topics. These professional trainings have become the

cornerstone  of  this  study.  The  researcher  (the  first  author)  played  the  role  of  psychologist,

transcriber,  and  data  analyzer.  Each  role  had  appropriate  intervals  and  preparation  time  to

ensure the clarity and completeness of the data. The researcher also conducted content analysis

with research collaborators and referred to family interview records and the test results of the

173

Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) to conduct triangulation to improve the reliability and

validity of the study.

(2) Research Collaborators

The  research  collaborator  is  also  a  clinical  psychologist  and  a  doctoral  student  in  the

Department of Guidance and Counseling who has taken courses related to counseling theory

topics. The research collaborator works in a medical institution and has received object relations

supervision for over ten years; responsible for the analysis and revision of research data in this

study to improve the reliability and validity of this study.

(3) Basic Information of the Case "Xiao-Mei" (Pseudonym)

1. Content provided by the referring unit and family members

The information  in  this section comes from  the  data collected by the researcher during

interviews  with  the  referral  unit  and  the  father.  The  pseudonym  of  the  case  in  this  study  is

"Xiao-Mei." She is a single woman aged about 25-30 years old. "Xiao-Mei" suffers from severe

depression and has expressed self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Therefore, "Xiao-Mei" has gone

to the psychosomatic clinic for outpatient treatment and medication. And suicide notification.

In addition, because of her poor physical and mental condition, her father suggested that "Xiao-

Mei" receive psychological treatment at her own expense. After "Xiao-Mei" agreed, her father

told  the  referral  agency  she  would  pay  for  unlimited  consultations.  He  just  hoped  that  his

daughter would not seek death.! The researcher can feel that the father is worried about Xiao-

Mei's physical and mental condition and seems to expect that "Xiao-Mei" can regain her mental

health at all costs. At the same time, he can also see that under the traditional image of a father,

this may be the father expressing his love for his child. However, it is impossible to express

love to the child directly. Here, we also see the emotional expression of father and daughter in

traditional Chinese patriarchal society. It is restrained and hidden and will only be revealed to

medical staff when it is a matter of life and death.

2. The Case's Description of Past Physical and Mental Conditions

          During the meeting, I learned that Xiao-Mei said:

174

"I have received psychotherapy in the past. During the counseling process, if I

feel that the psychologist I am meeting with is unsuitable, I will not go back after

one conversation, so I have changed several psychologists." (C-01-007)

After  hearing  such  content,  the  psychologist  felt  that  Xiao-Mei  was  decisive  in  doing

things.  However,  the  psychologist  also  felt  the  pressure  to  help  Xiao-Mei,  so  he  was  extra

cautious  about  establishing a relationship. This  first meeting will  also  determine Xiao-Mei's

future, which is the key to continued treatment.

During the interview, it was learned that Xiao-Mei worked briefly after graduating from

college and has been unemployed for five years. During this period, Xiao-Mei suffered from

psychosomatic disease. It can be understood from Xiao-Mei’s family of origin that her parents

divorced when she was young. From then on, Xiao-Mei, as an only child, became the scapegoat

for her parents’ discord or the target of projection in her father’s family when discussing her

parents’ divorce. As the father is the eldest son in the family and the case is an only child, Xiao-

Mei said:

"I  often  inexplicably  accept  the  concepts  of  passing  on  the  family  line  and

honoring  my  ancestors  from  traditional  family  culture.  I  don't  like  my  female

gender. I usually dress in neutral clothes and ride a gearbox motorcycle." (C-01-

010)

Therefore,  according  to  the  psychologist's  observation,  Xiao-Mei,  who  looks  soft  and

gentle, usually wears her long hair tied up and behaves very capable and masculinely. She wants

to play the role of sharing family pressure and uniting family emotions.

When  Xiao-Mei  lived  with  her  mother  before  she  was  15  years  old,  she  feels  been

suffering  because  of  her  mother's  manic  depression.  The  mother's  demands  on  academic

performance in English were too high for Xiao-Mei to bear. Xiao-Mei would be punished if she

did not comply, almost no opportunities for choice and expression, and was quite depressed

since childhood and suffered a lot of unstable emotions and physical violence from her mother.

This situation lasted until she was 15 years old and entering high school. But Xiao-Mei also

said that later, she studied foreign languages in college and had the opportunity to study abroad.

This was also an advantage brought by her better English skills. From here, we can roughly

understand that Xiao-Mei's life situation since childhood was in a state of extreme restriction

and  control.  There  was  no  other  life  development  except  studying.  Her  mother's  emotional

175

fluctuations also caused Xiao-Mei to be extremely sensitive, fragile, easily fearful, and have a

masochistic psychological state.

Xiao-Mei’s parents decided who she would live with from childhood to adulthood. After

Xiao-Mei turned 15, she moved to live with her father due to further education and financial

considerations so she could leave her mother’s control. Xiao Mei, who was treated violently,

could be said to be relieved. Then Xiao-Mei said during the counseling:

"It wasn't until I moved to my dad's house that I met my mom once when my dad

and I were checking out at a store. I still didn't dare to look directly at my mom. I

was afraid my mom would scold me again, so I only dared to hide behind my dad

and look at my mom secretly." (C-01-015)

As an adult, Xiao-Mei recalled her fear when she was with her mother before she was 15.

She still vaguely remembered it and found it unforgettable during the interview, and she has

never  interacted  with  her  mother  again.  However,  Xiao-Mei,  who  lives  with  her  father,  has

problems getting along. Because the father and daughter have rarely interacted with each other

for  many  years,  Xiao-Mei,  who  is  in  adolescence,  is  in  the  process  of  finding  her  own  role

identity or interpersonal relationships. At this stage, many self-concepts are also in conflict and

conflict, such as: Why was I born into such a family? Why do I exist in this world? What kind

of person am I? What do I like about myself or others? Xiao-Mei also began to have a lot of

doubts  about  her  existential  issues.  Still,  Xiao-Mei  also  found  that  both  she  and  her  father

expressed  themselves  in  a  passive  and  repressed  way.  Hence,  the  relationship  and

communication between the two parties were at a standstill. During the counseling, Xiao-Mei

said that her relationship with her family was suffocating, from her relationship with her mother,

in a state of high stress and emotional breakdown due to being abused, to her relationship with

her father, in a state of cold, isolated, lacking in help, and without flexibility. The most severe

thing is that Xiao-Mei doesn't like herself, let alone living like this. Xiao-Mei deeply feels that

only her death can end this pain.

III. Research results

1. Counseling Goals and Process

176

The goal of counseling is to deal with the inner lack and trauma issues of the case. From

the description of the past physical and mental conditions of the cases interviewed by the above

researcher, it can be found that the requirements and pressure from the traditional family culture

significantly  impact  the  instances.  The  following  will  use  the  Jungian  orientation.  The

intervention of expressive art therapy further understands that the client has never understood

her emotions. Through sandtray therapy, it can be said that the client can feel how strong her

subconscious and emotions are through vision and touch. In the past, the client had been unable

to  be  at  peace  with  herself,  and  because  the  intense  emotions  made  her  to  sense  her  own

existence, it gave her a good start in taking good care of herself. Therefore, in subsequent dream

analysis  and  fairy  tale  therapy,  we  saw  that  the  client  released  more  emotions  that  she  had

suppressed in the past. There are feelins of sadness, melancholy, loneliness, curiosity, humor,

and disgust. In this case, she can learn to adjust and cope with it, which further helps Xiao-Mei

embody the entanglement of her inner mother complex and find a way to reconcile with her

inner self. Later in the meeting, the client and her father were filled with tears during the parent-

child meeting, which melted and released the iceberg in the father's and daughter's hearts. The

layers of unspoken feelings in their hearts were indeed expressed. At the same time, the case

was also moving forward. In the subsequent interviews, the self-attacking and hurtful behaviors

gradually eased, and the self-moved towards a self that could choose and adjust self-integration

and find new life goals and priorities. The researcher used a Jungian perspective to analyze and

understand the content of the case in expressive art therapy. Counseling included 12 individual

sessions and 1oneparent-child session (father and daughter). The description is as follows:

5th meeting

The  researcher  found  that  during  the  previous  treatment,  the  client

experienced  the  closeness  to  the  subconscious  brought  about  by  the

177

sandtray therapy process, and was resistant to the emotions or thoughts

it evoked. Therefore, the client stated that she was unwilling to undergo

sandtray therapy again this time. The researcher therefore arranged for

the cases to experience transcendent functions instead.

2. Case Conceptualization

Xiao-Mei grew up in a family with a poor relationship between her parents. She faced the

life of a single parent after her parents divorced at an early age. During the first 15 years of

living with her mother, she endured high academic pressure and was often subjected to physical

and mental violence. This also created Xiao-Mei, who has a relatively repressed and nervous

personality. She lived with her father after adolescence. Her father was a company's CEO and

was busy working in essential positions. The relationship between father and daughter had been

alienated  for  a  long  time,  and  Xiao-Mei  eventually  developed  symptoms  of  depression  and

committed suicide thoughts. Xiao-Mei has been under a lot of mental pressure since she was a

child  due  to  long-term  poor  communication,  mutual  suspicion,  and  quarrels  in  her  parent's

marriage.  She  rationally  agrees  with  her  father  but  is  emotionally  close  to  her  mother.  In

addition, as the father is the eldest son in the family and the client is an only child, the client

needs to bear the pressure from the family culture to carry on the family line and honor the

ancestors. The concept of filial piety also urges Xiao-Mei to concentrate on condensing family

178

emotions after she becomes an adult. Playing a vital role becomes Xiao-Mei's shadow of the

high pressure of getting along with her parents or among family members.

Xiao-Mei often thinks she has no life left to live in her adult life. When she feels that she

cannot meet her requirements or is not as good as others, she cries bitterly. Xiao-Mei is also in

a  state  of  ambivalence  and  conflict  with  the  identity  of  her  parents.  Emotionally  longing  to

connect with her mother, we can glimpse it through the interaction between two big and small

crocodiles in  Xiao-Mei's sandtray therapy.  In other words, the little crocodile in  her father's

house was born from the giant crocodile in the witch's house. Being sent to live in her father's

home from  the witch's  house is  very similar to  the fact  that the case was sent  to  live in  her

father's house when she was 15 years old because of her studies. However, the case's mother

complex has not disappeared, and Xiao-Mei's character still makes her resemble her mother

deeply. Deeply connected, the father is only good at working to make money to support the

family  but  is  not  good  at  expressing  emotions,  leading  to  the  alienation  from  Xiao-Mei.

Researchers refer to Klein's (1946) object relations discussion of melancholy. Individuals will

project their hatred of the death instinct onto bad breasts or penises, but they will also project

feelings of love when the individual finds that they are projecting on the same. When people

are depressed, depression develops. In real life, Xiao-Mei has never developed her focus in life,

and recalling the painful past makes Xiao-Mei often doubt the meaning of her existence and

even attempt to attack herself by committing suicide.

Through  counseling,  the  researcher  helped  Xiao-Mei  express  and  clarify  many  of  her

feelings and helped Xiao-Mei distinguish between her parents' marital problems and issues that

developed during her growth. Xiao-Mei often cried during the process, which seemed to show

Xiao-Mei's  desire  to  be  understood  and  her  experience  that  she  may  have  never  been  well

understood or treated in the past. Jungian-oriented expressive art therapy provides a tolerant

space for cases with severe emotional distress, allowing the cases to have the opportunity to

face opposites and shadows, thereby creating a transformed sense of existence and meaning.

3. Therapeutic Intervention

(1) Sandtray Treatment

Figure 1

Full Picture of Sandtray

179

a. Initial Sandtray Analysis

The initial sandtray (Figure 1) shows that the types and quantities of objects used are pretty

rich. Kalff (1980) believed that the initial sandtray has at least several characteristics, such as

the case's feelings about treatment, the relationship between the case and the subconscious, and

the case's problems and solutions. The case shows primitive animal instincts in the lower half

of the sandtray. The role of human beings in the sandtray is leadership or control. Therefore, it

can be understood that what  humans display on the sandtray is  mainly functional,  and Jung

mentioned functions. Sex has a decisive influence on consciousness (Sharp, 2012/1983). Most

of the other objects in the sandtray are animals. Xiao-Mei said:

"This  is  my  first  time  to  try  sand  play  therapy.  I  named  the  sandtray  Minecraft.

There is a pool in the middle of the sandtray. After setting it up, I felt the pool was

not  big  enough.  The  animals  need  to  know  each  other  through  Mr.  Rabbit's

communication, so everyone is all friends." (C-03-003)

The sandtray is divided into five parts, and the position of the objects symbolizes the state

of the inner world (Ruth, 1998); they are the father's home in the upper left corner, the mother's

home in the upper right corner, the pool in the middle, the ancient ruins in the lower left corner,

and the entire group of dinosaurs in the lower right corner. The first object put in is the bridge,

180

and  the  pool  represents  the  contact  between  Xiao-Mei's  inner  and  subconscious.  From  the

position and size of the sandtray, it seems that it is the core position in the center, but the range

of contact is not extensive. It may be Xiao-Mei's inner body. -Mei still has some scruples about

subconscious contact and may have hidden or suppressed many emotions and events. This may

also be the way Xiao-Mei learned from her high-pressure mother since she was a child. The

fish in the pool are crowded and stacked together, like crucian carp crossing a river, which is

far from the state of swimming freely in the water. It can also be seen that Xiao-Mei has a strong

feeling about how to survive competition. In addition, Xiao-Mei chose Mr. Rabbit as the main

character to communicate with other animals. The softness and jumping of the rabbit symbolize

elasticity,  and  the  cunning  rabbit  has  three  homes  (Chinese  Sayings),  which  also  means

flexibility or cunning. The rabbit is one of the symbols of Easter in the West (Matthews, 1993;

Terri, 2006). The rabbit symbol can show that Xiao-Mei's inner world may also have flexibility

and problem-solving abilities.

In the lower-left corner, which represents Xiao-Mei's inner world, we can also see many

historical monuments placed there. We can appreciate the individual nostalgia and the degree

of influence from traditional family culture, as well as the collective subconscious that ancient

culture and tradition have deeply affected Xiao-Mei, just like Xiao-Mei, who is studying in the

Department of Foreign Languages and Literature in another county, returns to the countryside

every  week  to  accompany  her  grandfather  and  grandmother,  assisting  family  relatives  in

communicating and coordinating, making the family happy and fulfilling her filial piety, and

partially replacing her mother as the daughter-in-law in the family. For Xiao-Mei, who suffers

from major depression, when inner tradition collides with outer modernization, the researcher

observed that the case might be isolated from the world due to psychosomatic disorder, just like

standing in the aliens or astronauts next to the monuments as awkward as they are. In the leap

from ancient times to modern civilization, we can also see the display of transcendent functions,

such as the scene of grass placed next to monuments and the lifeless monuments covered in

snow, forming a strong contrast. Kalsched (2013/2022) also mentioned that green is the color

of life and rebirth in the form of plants. She looks forward to the coming of spring one day,

which is also the coming of the transformation of Xiao-Mei's inner hope.

The large number of dinosaurs in the lower right corner symbolizes the original aggression,

which may be related to survival defense (Matthews, 1993). It seems that Xiao-Mei needs a

significant enough number to feel at ease, and the way Xiao-Mei arranges the dinosaurs is to

combine all the dinosaurs’ objects are dumped into the sandtray.

b. Contents in the Initial Sandtray

181

(a) The Current Situation of the Two Homes

          Xiao-Mei said:

"There are two homes in the sandtray; one is where I currently live with my father,

and the other is the witch's home. In reality, my father is a scholar type with a slow

and slow attitude toward work, but he is very bold in making decisions and usually

does not see any emotions. My reaction is that I am often busy with work, and my

father performs very well  at  work; there is  also  my favorite little crocodile in  the

sandtray, which the witch gave me. I also hope to maintain a friendly relationship

with the witch, but the crocodile is very hot, like a person with a bad temper, just like

my mother and me; it reminds me of my mother who has a bad temper. Usually my

mother  cares  about  me  but  also  has  high  life  and  academic  performance

requirements.  She  would  like  me  to  behave  like  Ladies;  my  grades,  especially  my

English skills, must be excellent. If my performance is not as good as my mother's

expectations, I will be treated with physical or verbal violence by my mother." (C-

03-009)

During the sandtray treatment, the client mentioned two homes, namely her father's home

and the witch's home. The father's home provided food to nourish Xiao-Mei. In addition, many

military vehicles were also seen in the father's home. It seems that It has a great relationship

with the father's career in technology or discipline, symbolizing substantial wealth or control.

As for the witch's home and the many monsters guarding this part, you can first understand the

symbol  of  the  witch.  Kalsched  (1996/2018)  mentioned  that  witches  can  be  regarded  as  the

ability of the mind to self-paralyze or dissociate, freeze, and internally hypnotize the self. This

is similar to the relationship between Xiao-Mei and her mother. The relationship between the

two is close but also high-tension. Her mother's high degree of control and demands on Xiao-

Mei  often  makes  Xiao-Mei  feel  suffocated  or  out  of  breath.  Her  mother  hopes  that  she  can

achieve something and honor her ancestors. At the same time, Xiao-Mei also realized that she

also had a very bad-tempered part similar to her mother. Just like a witch's home was guarded

by many monsters, her mother treated Xiao-Mei with a more primitive instinct. Xiao-Mei also

inherited this instinct. At the same time, she has to suppress her instinct to interact with her

mother. After long-term relationship, she will have self-doubt about the meaning of existence;

especially when Xiao-Mei's performance in life and work is not as expected, Xiao-Mei does

not want to be disappointed with herself. Becoming a burden to others is also the main reason

182

for Xiao-Mei's self-injurious behavior or suicidal ideation. The role of mother presents high

demands  and  aggressive  behaviors  for  Xiao-Mei,  which  makes  Xiao-Mei  have  a  negative

mother complex in her heart, which is shadowed by the image of the witch. When Xiao-Mei

faced her own shadow, she understood that this was the self-protection system of the past, and

also saw that the individual cases relied on it to survive. Instead of denying its existence, she

gradually understood and learned it was an opportunity to be in harmony with her mother and

herself.

              For the issues  of  the two families to  become integrated  within Xiao-Mei,  her natural

innocence must endure experiential hardships, just like the suffering that Xiao-Mei has gone

through, even as a result of suffering from major depression. As Kalsched (2013/2022) said,

the suffering required in this process must be to experience enormous sadness and mourning in

consciousness. But only by going through this process can we move towards transformation

and get out of our trapped selves.

(b) True Temperament Resolves Interpersonal Difficulties

Johnson (1991/2021) mentioned that shadows are disgusting areas of our existence, and

in the story, the witch gave the little crocodile to Xiao-Mei, which became Xiao-Mei's favorite

gift. The subconscious also wanted Xiao-Mei to face the shadows in life. When Xiao-Mei was

free-associating, she thought of all the past things she had done with her classmates. Xiao-Mei

said that because she had a baby-sounding voice in her speech, her classmates often thought

that Xiao-Mei was artificial, so she was ostracized. One time, Xiao-Mei said vulgar words when

talking to her classmates, which made them feel friendly and interested. This incident seemed

to make Xiao-Mei discover that her true temperament is helpful for interpersonal relationships,

and her true temperament also reminded Xiao-Mei that her true temperament has also become

a gift that her mother gave her for her life. Therefore, the mother is Xiao-Mei's shadow but is

also a gift. This two-sided understanding also helps Xiao-Mei gradually gain a balance in her

heart and find a foothold in the face of setbacks.

  (c) Potential Emergence of the Case

Regarding the content in the center of the sandtray, Xiao-Mei said:

"A diver will take orders from Mr. Rabbit. Because rabbits are naturally afraid of

water,  they  need  the  help  of  professional  divers.  Mr.  Rabbit  constantly

communicates  with  other  animals  through  divers,  and  the  current  situation

between the animals is peaceful coexistence." (C -03-012)

183

In the process, it helps animals in the water and on land communicate, and the appearance

of the diver also conveys the symbol of Hermes. He is the god of boundaries, the god of paths

that wander between land and sea, and essentially exists in transitional time and space (Stein,

1987/2013);  subconsciously,  he  also  sees  Xiao-Mei’s  view  of  his  situation.  The  transition

between water and land and the process of Jungian-oriented expressive art therapy helped Xiao-

Mei see her ability to solve problems and respond to things. She will seek resources when faced

with things she cannot do, and she doesn’t only have to rely on her own efforts, that is, she is

very flexible in handling things.

(d) Primitive Instincts and Desires

Xiao-Mei placed a lot of dinosaur objects under the sandtray. After Xiao-Mei picked out

all the dinosaur objects in the treatment room, she put them on the sandtray. Xiao-Mei said that

because she likes dinosaurs very much, she wants to put all Dinosaurs on the plate; at the same

time, the researchers also observed that the case had an all-or-nothing style of doing things.

During  the  interview,  Xiao-Mei  said  she  was  prone  to  more  extreme  judgments  due  to  her

polarized likes and dislikes. Another thing researchers are worried about is that when Xiao-Mei

is entirely devoted to people or things and fails to receive a corresponding response or reward

for  her  efforts,  Feelings  of  loss  or  melancholy  may  occur.  From  a  symbolic  point  of  view,

animals  also  represent  the  instinctive  part  (Shi,  2016),  and  dinosaurs  are  powerful,  violent,

aggressive, and abundant in power (Matthews, 1993). If this part of the power is not handled

correctly, it may hurt oneself or others. Not toward others, Xiao-Mei seems to be hurting herself

more. For others, she wants to give back to her father after becoming successful in her career

and financially allowed. We can also understand Xiao-Mei's intention to fulfill her filial piety.

(e) The Feeling of Release but also Exhaustion

Xiao-Mei expressed her inner world and family problems through sandtray therapy and

used this process to express her depressed feelings and melancholy. Xiao-Mei said:

"After setting up the sandtray, I felt comfortable but exhausted. The comfortable

part was putting all the objects I liked on the sandtray, but the tired part was that

I felt physically and mentally exhausted. At the same time, I was worried that my

emotions would surge. Will I collapse? Or am I still not used to expressing my

feelings?" (C-03-020)

184

Therefore, there was some resistance to sandtray treatment in the follow-up interviews.

From this, the researcher also saw the contradiction in Xiao-Mei's heart and her shyness in the

depths of her heart. Therefore, the researcher respected and agreed with Xiao-Mei's decision

while also waiting and accompanying Xiao-Mei to prepare herself to face the problem.

        During  the  sandtray  therapy,  the  client  saw  opposites  and  the  need  to  be  understood.

According to the content of the trauma sandtray proposed by Mitchell and Friedman (2003),

Xiao-Mei's initial sandtray appeared chaotic, split, hindered, restricted, and threatened scenes.

We can understand that the trauma Xiao-Mei has endured since childhood cannot be ignored.

(2) Content Beyond Functions

The transcendental function used in this study is mainly a continuation of the concept in

sandtray therapy. The client is attracted to the objects, which inspires the client to present the

suppressed spiritual elements. The client selects three objects to represent the current problems

they are encountering. The object that is the opposite of the current problem and the object that

finally connects the two (Liang, 2016). The new insights formed through the symbolic meaning

of the case in the process create core concepts that break through the current problem and even

loosen the original issues fixed in the client's heart. It can be used to understand that finding a

new way out is possible when an individual transcends or escapes the current situation.

The researcher determined that Xiao-Mei said that after the initial sandtray was completed,

she felt that she had achieved the effect of expressing herself. Still, she also thought that she

was particularly prone to mental and physical exhaustion due to depression, so she expressed

that she was only willing to use objects that transcended functions to express herself.

Figure 2

Three Objects Selected by the Case

185

a.  The  selection  of  objects  once  again  projects  Xiao-Mei's  distinctive

characteristics

Xiao-Mei said:

"Regarding  the  choice  of  objects,  my  favorite  is  the  little  flying  squirrel.  It  is

adorable and small, just like I like to be cared for by others as the youngest. But I

wouldn't say I like the black mouse because I sometimes complain about things or

other people, and the self-pity part is very similar to the black mouse. The third

object connecting the little flying squirrel and the black mouse is dessert (Picture

2) because I like to eat dessert. Still, if the black mouse is the mother, I didn't want

to  share the dessert  with my mother, so I replaced it with a toilet and placed it

between the little flying squirrel and the black mouse (Picture 3)." (C-05-005)

Figure 3

Three Objects Replaced by the Case

After expressing the content of C-05-005, the case replaced the dessert object with a toilet

object.

b. Demonstration of Case Instinct

When Xiao-Mei experienced the transcendent function, she chose the little flying squirrel

that can walk on land and fly in the sky to represent herself and the annoying black mouse that

can  only  walk  on  the  ground  to  represent  the  inner  opposite  side.  As  Johnson  (1991/2021)

mentioned. The shadow is an abhorred area of our being. Therefore, initially, Xiao-Mei could

186

enjoy  her  favorite  dessert  with  the  black  mouse,  and  it  had  the  symbolic  meaning  of  self-

nourishment.  However,  when  Xiao-Mei  realized  that  the  black  mouse  was  her  mother,  she

chose the toilet instead of the dessert and expressed that she did not want to eat dessert with her

because her mother made many demands and criticized Xiao-Mei a lot. This shows that the

client's feelings toward her mother were mostly negative. It was also as if Xiao-Mei had endured

enough of the impact of this negative shadow on herself, and it was as if she was excreting

unwanted  things  from  her  heart,  breaking  away  from  the  control  of  the dark  side.  Kalsched

(1996/2018) mentioned that Jung believed the dark side was the case’s self-care system and

produced dissociative defenses. He also saw that Xiao-Mei’s major depression may also be the

product of his confrontation with the shadow in the real world, so only through adopting an

open attitude towards facing the shadow is it possible to get rid of the entanglement of major

depression.

(3) The Content of Dream Analysis

a. Dream

Xiao-Mei said:

"This is an ancient dream. In the dream, there was a woman with two children, a

boy  and  a  girl.  They  went  to  the  ancestral  hall  to  pray  for  peace  because  the

military husband had not been around for many days and did not know where he

was. However, when the woman was worshiping, she saw a naked male corpse

lying  in  the  water  of  the  pond  in  the  ancestral  hall.  This  male  corpse  was  the

husband of the woman. Xiao-Mei said that she was apprehensive about the woman

in her dream. People can't bear the blow and break down and cry, but I didn't

expect that the woman didn't cry when she saw the corpse. Instead, she kicked the

corpse. I was surprised and laughed, and then I woke up from the dream." (C-06-

004)

After understanding the dream narrated by Xiao-Mei, the researcher invited Xiao-Mei to

express the dream through clay creation further so that the abstraction could be transformed

into a concrete picture. Xiao-Mei agreed and created the following content:

b. Dream Clay Creation

In the clay creation part (Figure 4), you can see from the picture that an ancestral hall with

a red roof is on the left. Three people are standing in the ancestral hall, one of whom is a woman,

187

and the other two are children, a boy and a girl, The naked male corpse lying flat in the blue

pond is the woman's husband engaged in military service. Xiao-Mei said:

"Because the husband is dead, the expression on his face is crossed out, and the

corners  of  his  mouth  are  pointing  down.  On  the  far  right  is  a  yellow  mountain

standing beside the pond." (C-06-005)

The three people in the ancestral hall are of different body shapes: one large and two small.

The case description states that a mother and two children pray for spiritual peace and comfort.

Figure 4

Dream Clay Creation Picture

c. Four Stages of Dream Interpretation

(a) Lenovo

A. woman

Xiao-Mei said:

"In my dream, I was worried that the woman would be unable to bear the blow,

break down, and cry. But I didn't expect that the woman didn't cry when she saw

the body. Instead, she kicked the body. I was surprised and laughed, and then I

woke up from the dream." (C-06-004)

188

B. Naked body lying flat in the pond

Xiao-Mei said:

"This corpse is the husband of the woman who went to join the army. Moreover,

this man probably left without saying goodbye when he wanted to join the army, so

her family did not know his whereabouts until the war ended. Her husband wanted

to go home to see the family, but he was seriously injured and died in the pond in

the ancestral hall near her home." (C-06-008)

C. Two children

Xiao-Mei said:

"The child is a boy and a girl. Because his father is not around, he can only follow

his mother. He has no ideas of his own about his family or things." (C-06-010)

D. ancestral hall

Xiao-Mei said:

"The ancestral hall is a place where the family worships their ancestors. It is also

a place to seek peace of mind. People in the family will go to this ancestral hall to

worship if they have something unclear or want to seek peace." (C-06-012)

E. The shed of the ancestral hall

Xiao-Mei said:

"This red shed was built later because it can provide shelter from wind and rain so

that we can worship properly." (C-06-014)

During Xiao-Mei's narration, you can see that the woman and two children are covered

under the shed, which is in obvious contrast to the body parts lying naked in the pond.

F. Mountain

Xiao-Mei said:

189

"This is a yellow mountain, standing next to the ancestral hall, and the ancestral

hall is built in a sparsely populated suburb." (C-06-015)

G. Pond

Xiao-Mei said:

"The pond is not big and is located next to the ancestral hall." (C-06-016)

The  pond  in  the  dream  is  similar  to  the  pool  in  the  sandtray.  Xiao-Mei  explores  the

subconscious  idea,  but  the  scope  is  still  tiny,  and  there  may  be  self-limitation  and  inner

insecurity. Therefore, how to enhance Xiao-Mei's autonomy And the ability to solve problems

when  facing  them  is  also  an  issue  that  Xiao-Mei  still  needs  to  address  after  her  depression

tendency is alleviated.

(b) Exploration of Psychological Dynamics

A. The client felt that he looked like the woman in the dream

Xiao-Mei said:

"The woman in the dream is very much like me. Sometimes, she does things out of

order. So I originally thought that the woman would break down and cry when

she found out that her husband had passed away, but instead she kicked him. I felt

very Funny." (C-06-020)

The  researcher  also  felt  that  this  was  the  first  smile  that  Xiao-Mei  showed  after  6-7

interviews. The atmosphere was full of humor and relaxation. The researchers also looked at

each other and smiled. Silence seemed better than sound at this time. The melancholy haze that

lingered in Xiao-Mei's heart in the past has gradually cleared up with joy.

B. The client is aware of the inherent sacrificial qualities

Xiao-Mei said:

"The husband who joined the army sacrificed for the country, which is similar to

mine  because  I  also  sacrificed  for  my  family.  Among  the  grandchildren  in  my

family, I am the only one who goes back to my hometown to visit my grandparents

190

every week. In this part, Xiao-Mei described sacrificing a lot of her time, but I am

willing to continue doing this." (C-06-022)

C. The client recalled that she had the same behavior pattern of leaving without saying goodbye.

When the researcher asked Xiao-Mei to talk to the clay corpse lying in the pond, Xiao-

Mei said:

"I just want to say that I won't leave without saying goodbye like this in the future.

Although I know the husband is afraid that his family will be worried if he tells his

family about joining the army. But if he doesn't tell his family, his family may feel

lost. Talking about this also reminded Xiao-Mei of the past. When she went to study

abroad without saying goodbye, now that I have experienced the    family feeling of

loss, I feel that if I have to go on a long trip, it is better to say goodbye to my family

and not have any regrets." (C-06-024)

This process also made Xiao-Mei realize how to cherish her time with her family. Just

like the companionship that Xiao-Mei has always done in the past, its value and significance

are even more evident here.

D. The case found that the ancestral hall has a symbol of the family

An ancestral hall is where ancestors are worshipped and have the image of home.

Xiao-Mei said:

"I feel peaceful in this ancestral hall. It seems that whenever I feel at a loss, I want

to worship and seek peace of mind." (C-06-025)

From this, we find that Xiao-Mei’s feelings about home are contradictory. On the

one hand, it is where Xiao-Mei can calm her heart, but on the other hand, we can also

see the family's hope from Xiao-Mei’s self-report and background. Xiao-Mei can bring

glory to one's ancestors or become famous. For example, Xiao-Mei means:

"I often inexplicably bear the concept of inheriting the family line and honoring

my ancestors from traditional family culture, and I don't like my female gender."

(C-01-010)

191

Or, Xiao-Mei once said:

"Xiao-Mei said that her mother has a bad temper. She usually cares about Xiao-

Mei and has high life and academic performance requirements. She hopes Xiao-

Mei will behave like a lady, have excellent grades, and be the best in English. If I

don't  behave as  my mother wants,  I will  be physically or verbally abused by my

mother." (C-03-009)

As  for  Xiao-Mei,  as  a  female,  when  her  parents  are  divorced,  and  there  are  no  other

siblings to complain or share the pressure, Xiao-Mei often feels that she can't let go, is sorry,

and can't meet the burdens she needs to bear. This seems to be the case. The past that makes

Xiao-Mei so oppressive and breathless is the reason for her depression.

  (c) Interpretation

During  the  consultation  process,  Xiao-Mei  said  that  while the interpretation of dreams

was interesting, it could be seen that Xiao-Mei has a playful or humorous side. She also has the

archetype  of  a  prankster,  making  the  initially  tragic  story  a  bit  absurd  or  interesting  ability.

Therefore, we can also discover the power of self-repair within the client. Through the dialogue

and discovery between herself and herself in the dream, it seems that things she initially thought

were significant and challenging became manageable. Xiao-Mei's overall state is obviously a

tendency to be stable and comfortable, and the mood can also be lighter. In addition, through

the analysis of dreams, we can find that Xiao-Mei attaches great importance to filial piety. On

the one hand, she has always had a good relationship with her grandparents so that she will miss

her. On the other hand, it can also be seen that Xiao-Mei is a grandchild but still needs to provide

for her divorced father's mother's filial duties.

        (d) Ritualization

This part is mainly about the dreamer returning to daily life with the results of exploring

the dream. In the past, once Xiao-Mei realized that she was unable to achieve anything and had

become a burden to her family, she began to idea of committing suicide; in Xiao-Mei's dream,

just like Xiao-Mei's feelings about the dream, she changed from the original because of The

negative emotions brought about by nightmares. Still, in the treatment, through narration and

the creation of Jungian expressive art clay, Xiao-Mei discovered that the gentleman who left to

192

join the army without saying goodbye died in a pond not far from the ancestral hall at home.

The reaction of the wife of the military gentleman, that is, the woman who saw the body and

kicked her feet, was a big difference from the case where the client initially thought that the

woman in the dream would collapse and cry. This move stimulated and gave back to Xiao-Mei.

When things turned out not to be as bad or sad as she initially thought, she also showed a smile

and dawn of rebirth, and her perspective on things increased resilience and a sense of hope.

  (4) Contents of Fairy Tale Analysis

After the researcher conducted a dream analysis with Xiao-Mei, she found that Xiao-Mei

had her own insights and feelings in the description of the story. So, she continued to invite

Xiao-Mei to share the fairy tales that impressed her most since she was a child. Xiao-Mei also

naturally told two stories, namely Christmas gifts and the last leaf.

a. The First Story: Christmas Gift

Xiao-Mei said:

"The story is about a poor couple who loved each other and wanted to give each

other a Christmas gift. As a result, the wife cut off her long hair, sold it, and bought

the husband a chain to hang his pocket watch. But, the husband sold his pocket

watch and bought a comb for his wife to comb her long hair. After Xiao-Mei told

this  story,  she  felt  that  the  artistic  conception  was  very  beautiful  because  both

parties were willing to sell their most precious things and use the money to buy

things for each other. They have the mind to want to give each other the best." (C-

09-002)

In this story, we see the issue of sacrifice. The focus is  on sacrificing  yourself to  help

others. Just like Xiao-Mei spends her most valuable time with her grandparents. In Xiao-Mei’s

heart, family is the most critical thing she cares about and values. In addition, we can also see

Xiao-Mei’s thoughts on how to stick together a broken family after her parents divorced. Xiao-

Mei seems to want to do her best through filial piety, which again echoes the Eastern culture.

The invisible pressure and shackles brought to Xiao-Mei by the spirit of filial piety.

b. The Second Story, The Last Leaf

Xiao-Mei said:

193

"The  story  is  about  a  sick  girl  who  watched  the  leaves  of  the  tree  outside  the

window falling one by one every day and told others that when the last leaf fell, it

was the time when she died. The guard uncle heard the little girl say this, so The

guard uncle painted another big tree on the wall behind this big tree. When the

leaves on the tree fell more and more sparse, the little girl saw the big tree painted

on the wall, which still looked like this. As a result, the little girl gained confidence

in  the  face  of  the  disease.  Strangely  enough,  the  disease  gradually  improved.

However, the guard uncle who painted trees on the wall froze to death because he

was painting outdoors in the cold at that time. " (C- 09-012)

After telling the story, Xiao-Mei said:

"I thought of my grandpa and found that I would cry very sadly whenever I saw

movies  or  scenes  about  the  death  of  the  old  man.  It  reminded  Xiao-Mei  of  the

importance of Grandpa to her and that he was the best person for her. In addition,

Xiao-Mei also said that the other person that comes to mind in this fairy tale is her

father, and she also cares a lot about her father. However, because both of them

suppress their emotions, they cannot express love, liking, sadness, or anger at all,

so if it happens during a quarrel, it will also be discovered that there seems to be a

huge misunderstanding of each other's hearts." (C-09-014)

This  was  also  the  motivation  that  prompted  the  researcher  to  arrange  future  father-

daughter interviews. As the conversation progressed, Xiao-Mei gradually began to say things

like cherishing things and not letting her family worry about her. Xiao-Mei shed tears again and

said  that  these  two  stories  are  about  relationships,  and  the  researcher  also  shared  the  same

sentiment. These two stories seem also to tell the story of Xiao-Mei’s strong and inextricable

emotions  with  her  family.  Because  of  the  intense  emotions,  they  were  also  the  root  of  the

problem that made Xiao-Mei feel painful and unable to cope with herself in the past. Through

counseling repeatedly, as if After going through the process from death to rebirth in the story,

the old self must die, and the new self will grow, making Xiao-Mei more and more able to face

herself.

4. Pre and Post Tests Results of the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5)

194

In the pre and post tests of the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) presented by the

clients during the consultation, the two scores of feeling depressed and having suicidal thoughts

dropped from 4 points of very severe to 1 point of a mild degree and no suicidal thoughts; the

total score was the score for psychiatric referral was reduced from 19 points to 7 points for mild

emotional distress.

1. Conclusion

IV. Discussion and Conclusion

  (1) Five Major Themes Presented by the Case During Treatment

During the treatment process, the themes of the client are naturally revealed layer by layer

(Ray,  2011/2014).  There  are  recurring  themes,  which  usually  symbolize  what  the  client  is

currently encountering and dealing with: issues, Experience, and inner conflict (Giordano, &

Landreth, 2008/2005); and the following five themes can be sorted out based on the repetition,

intensity, and contextual characteristics of the theme (Ray, 2016):

a. Power/control (Number of Times: 1, 3)

This theme implies that the client has been subjected to violence and pressure in the family

since childhood. The client is forced to work hard because of patriarchalism. When the client

fails to meet the mother's standards, she is beaten and humiliated. For example: "Until I moved

to my father's house, I once met my mother when my father and I were checking out at a store.

I still didn't dare to look directly at my mother. I feared my mother would scold me again, so I

only dared to hide behind my father and secretly look at my mother." (C- 01 -015) and the issue

of  the  two  homes  in  the  initial  sandtray.  The  father's  house  has  many  military  vehicles,

symbolizing  substantial  wealth  or  control,  and  many  monsters  guard  the  witch's  house.  The

mother treats Xiao-Mei with a more primitive instinct, and Xiao-Mei also inherits this instinct.

At the same time, she has to suppress her instinct to interact with her mother. After a long-term

relationship,  she  will  doubt  the  meaning  of  existence.  For  example:  "My  mother  has  a  bad

temper. She cares about Xiao-Mei and has high life and academic performance requirements.

If  I  don't  get  her  way,  I will  be  treated  with  physical  or  verbal  violence"  (C-03-009)  These

contents illustrate the case. Growing up under the power/control of her mother, the case, as a

single girl, also endured the traditional family expectations of her children becoming successful

and their daughters becoming successful.

b. The Sadness and Reluctance of Parting (Number of Times: 1, 6, 8)

195

This theme can be seen as the case faces the value of separation. Most of the time, the

case is more negative and sadder. The case often has the idea that life is hopeless in adult life.

The case feels that it cannot meet its own requirements or that it is better to break down and cry

bitterly. The client may even feel that living is a burden or burden to the family and have the

idea of death. Such thoughts linger in the client's mind.

For  example,  during  the  analysis  of  the  dream,  the  client  saw  the  description  of  the

negative  emotions  brought  about  by  the  nightmare:  "In  the  dream,  a  woman  went  to  the

ancestral hall to pray for peace, because her military husband had not been around for many

days and don't know where is he." and "There was a naked male corpse lying in the water in

the pond in the ancestral hall. This male corpse was the woman's husband. Xia-Mei expressed

that in her dream, she was worried that the woman would not be able to withstand the blow

and break down and cry." (C-06-004)

The researcher found that the client had deep emotions and feelings about her family in

the description of the dream. From the dream about the husband and the woman left without

saying goodbye, she recalled the same behavior pattern in the past, so she continued to invite

the  client  to  share  her  impressions  from  childhood  to  adulthood.  It  is  a  profound  fairy  tale,

starting from the story of a poor couple who love each other and give each other Christmas gifts:

"Both parties are willing to sell their most precious things and then use the money to buy things

for each other. They both have a heart to give each other person the "best.” (C-09-002) This

story  also  sees  the  issue  of  client  sacrifice.  The  client  always  hopes  that  she  can  meet  her

family's expectations first. As for the life she wants, she always seems to sacrifice and doesn't

mention it.

Another fairy tale about the last leaf reminded the client of her grandfather. At this time,

she  once  again  saw  the  client's  parting  with  her  family.  For  example:  "Thinking  of  her

grandfather reminded Xiao-Mei of the importance of her grandfather to him. He is the person

who treats her best. In addition, Xiao-Mei also said that the other person she reminds of in this

fairy tale is her father, and she also cares a lot about her father." (C-09-014). The display of

these emotions happens to be what the case has said in the past. It is depressing. Through such

content,  we  can  see  the  client's  reluctance  to  leave.  This  theme  has  also  become  one  of  the

important key factors in treatment.

c. Division and Connection (Number of Times: 3, 5, 8, 10, 11-13)

The client was faced with the life of a single parent after her parents divorced when she

was young. She first lived with her mother for 15 years and then moved to her father's house

for more than ten years because of her further education. However, the fear of her mother did

196

not seem to diminish. Such transitions in life have led to a split in the client's heart. This is also

revealed  in  the  sandtray  therapy.  The  sandtray  is  divided  into  five  parts,  with  connections

between them. For example: "Mr. Rabbit continues to communicate with other animals through

the  diver.  Communication  and  the  current  situation  of  animals  getting  along  is  peaceful

coexistence." (C-03-012) This kind of content also reflects the real life of the case. When the

case is an only child in the family, she needs to bear the burden of family culture that needs to

continue the family line and honor the ancestors. Pressure and the concept of filial piety urge

Xiao-Mei  to  play  an important  role in  uniting family emotions  when she becomes  an adult.

However, we also see the positive meaning of the connection. For example: "Xiao-Mei also

said that there is a favorite little crocodile in the sandtray at home that the witch gave. The two

parties know each other and hope to maintain a friendly relationship." (C-03-009). Therefore,

how the client can make good use of her connection through this process instead of becoming

pressured is also an important change in treatment.

d. The Flexibility of Security and Freedom (Number of Times: 6, 10, 11-13)

This theme sees the case looking for sources of security, including spiritual parts, such as:

"In the dream, a woman went to the ancestral hall to pray for peace." (C-06-004) and the stable

life provided by the father, such as: "Xiao-Mei said that in real life, my father is very courageous

in making decisions and usually does not see any emotional reactions. My father has excellent

performance  at  work."  (C-03-009),  in  case  sandtray  therapy  It  shows  that  the  father's  home

provides food to nourish the client, and there are also many military vehicles, which seems to

have a great relationship with the father's career in technology or discipline, and also symbolizes

substantial wealth.

In addition, while gaining a sense of security, the case also had room for freedom and

flexibility.  For  example:  "Unexpectedly,  this  woman  did  not  cry  when  she  saw  the  corpse.

Instead, she kicked the corpse. I was surprised and laughed, and then I woke up from the dream.”

(C-06-004) The dream revealed subconscious content opposite to the client's real-life reaction.

This discovery surprised and made the client happy, and she saw the emergence of her freedom

and flexibility. In addition, in real life, the client began studying for the car driving license test

and preparing for graduate school studies.

e. Nourishing and Nurturing (Number of Times: 5, 6, 8, 10)

From  point  d,  we  can  see  that  the  client  gained  a  sense  of  security  from  her  father's

interaction and was nourished and nurtured simultaneously. In the transcendent function part,

we can also see that the case herself can nourish others and is willing to share, for example: "I

like to eat desserts, so I think the little flying squirrel that symbolizes what I like can be eaten

197

together with the black mouse that I don't like." (C-05-005) And the dream of the case: "In the

dream,  there  was  a  woman  with  two  children,  a  boy  and  a  girl."  (C-06-004).  Although  the

woman felt uneasy about her husband's whereabouts, she still took her children to seek inner

peace.  This  also  shows  that  even  though  the  case  was  anxious  and  driven  by  a  sense  of

responsibility, she will still try her best to fulfill the family's requirements. As for inner peace,

she will use spiritual power to help herself.

Five  essential  themes  that  emerged  in  case  therapy  can  be  sorted  out  from  the  above

content. The more stressful or prone to negative emotions are power/control, separation and

grief, differentiation and connection, security and freedom, and nourishing and nurturing, which

make the client feel more comfortable and at ease.

(2) Self-Development and Transformation of Client

The client was a young single female who suffered from severe depression. She had self-

injurious behavior and suicidal thoughts in the past, and she went to the mental and physical

department for treatment. In early adulthood, women have discordant relationships with their

parents and unstable parenting functions. In addition, the case in this study is an only child at

home  and  has  no  other  siblings  to  share  the  pressure  of  family  care.  This  has  also  caused

significant  physical  and  mental  consequences  Impact.  For  example,  Huang  et  al.  (2010)

mentioned  that  in  this  situation,  it  is  easy  for  individuals  to  be  sensitive  to  the  needs  and

evaluations of others, ignore their emotional care, sacrifice for opportunities and positions to

be seen, feel unfair and mistreated in relationships, and pursue achievement and desire to be

recognized. Aspects of the self that focus on. In addition to seeing these tendencies in the cases

in this study, we can also see the phenomenon of the instances being instrumental or becoming

emotional spouses during the period when the case lived with her mother before the age of 15,

in  addition  to  achieving  academic  achievements.  The  mother's  high  pressure  and  high

expectations  also  accompanied  her  mother's  emotional  adjustment  after  becoming  a  single

parent. Therefore, while her self-emotional regulation ability was still developing, the client

took on more emotional pressure than she could bear and even learned to be anxious—a crazy

way of dealing with emotions. The client lived with her father after the age of 15. Her father's

rigorous character and overly rational approach also made the client feel indifferent in terms of

emotional regulation, and he suddenly lost his dependence on the relationship, making the client

feel depressed. The client lived in the parent's relationships and interactions, which were hot

and cold. And the client failed to adapt well, causing physical and mental harm.

198

Therefore, in this study, through Jungian-oriented expressive art therapy, the client gained

a  deep  understanding  of  how  his  depression  and  the  conflicting  emotions  between  love  and

demands in family relationships affected her self-development and parent-child relationship,

resulting  in  past  problems  of  a  vicious  cycle.  This  study  also  helps  the  client  identify  the

influence of family culture, the impact of the concept of filial piety in the local culture, and the

role that family culture plays in the critical bonding of family emotions. It can also get closer

to the case's long-term depression and stress sources. This study shows that Jungian-oriented

play therapy has apparent effects on cases of severe emotional distress. It provides a space for

tolerance in the plight of the case so that the opposites and shadows within the case are gradually

integrated. The case develops a sense of existence and meaning in the transformation experience.

For those who once wanted to die to get rid of their difficulties in life, it is quite the artistic

conception of rebirth after death. During the counseling process, we can also feel the impact of

the case's filial piety concept in the local culture and the role that family culture plays in uniting

family emotions. We can also get closer to the case's depression and sources of stress through

consultation.  In the process,  the client  learns to  achieve a balance rather than excessive and

inadequate  love  and  appropriately  arranges  opportunities  to  participate  in  parent-child

communication talks. This method is more conducive to multiple changes in the client and the

client's family.

In real life, the client has indeed found the goal and focus of life again. She plans to study

abroad or even immigrate abroad. She has also started practicing in life by getting a driver's

license and going to graduate school. This can be regarded as a new beginning in life, and this

time there will be no more for the expectations of parents or family, but it is to start living for

herself.

(3) Update of Case Life Context

The  client  has  successfully  passed  the  driving  license  test  and  has  been  admitted  to

graduate school for further study. She is also expected to apply abroad for an internship in a

future graduate school and yearns for a foreign living environment. In addition, the big stone in

her heart has been put down, and she can express her feelings smoothly to her family. Thoughts

and emotions, this treatment can be said to have cleared up the depression in the past and the

helplessness of not being able to find a way out. Therefore, the client even expressed that she

also  wanted  to  work  and  settle  abroad  in  the  future,  which  clearly  shows  the  client's

individuality. The process of transformation also leads her to a broad road. This is a path to her

own inner needs, not to the needs of others.

199

2. Discussion

(1)  Connecting  Oneself  with  the  Symbol  of  the  Little  Mermaid  During  the  Treatment

Process—Returning to the sea

The client mentioned that her English name is "Ariel", which is the same as the protagonist

in The Little Mermaid. This name is a male name in Spanish culture. The client said that she

liked the story of The Little Mermaid very much, so she used this name. The story of the Little

Mermaid  was  mentioned  in  the  fairy  tale  analysis  by  Guo  and  Huang  (2017)  that  the  Little

Mermaid symbolizes the collective subconscious prototype of Anima. It was originally called

the daughter of the sea and is related to "the sea, water, fish and women".

According to Jung's archetypal perspective, water is the most common symbol of female

energy,  the  anima  subconscious.  The  mind  contains  multiple  opposing  elements,  such  as

feminine  and  masculine,  and  the  process  of  integration  and  balance  is  the  process  of

individuation  (Jung,  1969/1980);  this  moment  is  precisely  what  the  client  is  experiencing.

Starting from the fact that her English name is the same as the name of the Little Mermaid, the

client  experienced  many  Yin  and  Yang  oppositions,  the  opposition  of  the  inner  maternal

complex, and the integration of the personality mask and the shadow side. As Jung (1995) said,

the process is the integration of opposites. The process of the Little Mermaid returning to the

sea is what Xiao-Mei has been constantly experiencing in her transformation experience.

(2) Enlightenment of the Way to Escape Suffering and Gain Happiness—Transforming from

Melancholy and Self-Isolation to Flexibility and Adaptability.

In the transcendental function experience, the client once chose the annoying black mouse

to represent the mother's negative feelings in Xiao-Mei's heart and chose the toilet as the third

party of the transcendental function. Von Franz (1970/2018) once mentioned that in the hero's

journey, if a monster swallows the hero, there is no way out. In this study, the client chose the

toilet to symbolize the transcendent function, which is also like something being flushed down

the toilet. It has never appeared again. The black mouse is like the shadow in the client's heart.

Facing  the  shadow  of  inner  darkness  and  violence,  it  finally  swallows,  transforms,  and

integrates  to  heal  its  own  trauma.  According  to  the  researcher's  observation,  the  client  also

transcends the three objects in this way. After analyzing dreams, we can also see that the client's

emotions are increasingly moving toward integration (Johnson, 1991/2021). In addition, in the

study  of  You  et  al.  (2021),  it  was  also  mentioned  that  the  causes  of  interpersonal  stress  in

200

Chinese organizations can be divided into tolerance peacekeeping, cognitive adjustment, and

passive avoidance. The client can be said to be in the form of tolerance peacekeeping or passive

avoidance because understanding and accepting oneself gradually leads to cognitive adjustment.

Cheng (2003) focused on people's coping flexibility, the ability to distinguish and take action

when facing stressful events, and the ability to achieve better mental health adaptation. In this

study,  after  the  client  gradually  became  able  to  identify  the  influence  of  family  culture  on

himself, in the analysis of dreams, it can be seen that the client has a playful or humorous side

and the prototype of a prankster, making the initially tragic story enjoyable. This differs from

the past when the client  always thought negatively and worried about the results. When she

discovered  from  her  subconscious  experience  that  the  development  of  things  was  not  as

pessimistic as she wanted, the client opened up the possibility of accepting different results, just

like the client himself. The wise old man is teaching the client how to escape suffering and gain

happiness. When the client brought the insights from dream exploration back to her daily life

and reflected on how her past lack of accomplishments had made her a burden to her family,

suicide thoughts arouse. However, this dream sequence where the husband left for army without

saying goodbye and the wife’s reaction of kicking his body after his death, seemed to reveal an

understanding that the development of things may not be as bad or pessimistic as she thought.

It  also  showed  a  smile  and  dawn  of  rebirth,  allowing  the  client  to  reveal  through  the

subconscious mind that the outcome of things is not necessarily negative; the view of things

also increases flexibility and hope. As Kalsched (2013/2022) mentioned, individuals will find

the courage to bear the pain of specific past traumas. In this study, it can indeed be seen that the

client breaks through the current situation and enters a broader state of self-acceptance, breaking

away from the state of victimization or self-blame. Therefore, we can also discover the client's

inner self-healing power. Through the dialogue and discovery between herself and herself in

the  dream,  it  seems  that  things  that  initially  seemed  big  and  difficult  can  be  faced,  and  the

client's  overall  state  becomes  obviously  stable  and  comfortable.  Emotions  are  also  lighter,

resulting in the ability to integrate.

(3)  The  Relationship  between  Father  and  Daughter  is  Resolved  through  the  Father’s

Monologue

The father and daughter walked into the interview room, holding hands. It seemed that the

father cared a lot about the client. The client can also adjust from the more reverse and negative

way of expressing emotions in the past to a more direct and positive way of expression. During

the meeting, the client talked a lot about getting along with her father. The client said that her

201

father loved mountain climbing, so father and daughter would go hiking together in the past.

The father also said he would force the client to exercise in the past, but now he has learned to

respect her.

The researcher also helped the client express concerns and misunderstandings in the past.

Through explanations and clarifications, the two parties understood each other better and could

better understand how to handle future interactions. The father always showed a severe side of

the past, and he naturally showed the image of a strict father and a loving mother during the

meeting. During the meeting, the father’s monologue can be said to be the key to breaking the

ice in the father-daughter relationship:

"Xiao-Mei has lived with me since she was 15 years old because I have been busy

with work and neglected to get along with my family for a long time. I have never

known how to interact with an adolescent daughter, so I am mostly at a loss and

a  little  scared.  I  am  the  company's  CEO,  and  my  colleagues  take  my  orders.

However, after work, I will ask several male colleagues who have daughters to

stay. I want to know how a father should raise a teenage daughter. I asked my

colleagues for advice because I want to be a good father, and I also hope that the

relationship between father and daughter can gradually improve." (F-10-0 "0)"

Xiao-Mei, listening to her father's monologue, then burst into tears. She heard her father's

helplessness and efforts to change the relationship, and she also hugged her father to express

her gratitude. At this time, the father and daughter experienced a sacred moment when their

relationship was resolved. This minute and second was so precious, and the true love between

the two was revealed, and the researcher was also moved by it. This reminds the researcher that

Xiao-Mei  was  the  first  bridge  object  placed  in  the  initial  sandtray  of  sand  play  therapy.  Its

symbolic communication function (Matthews, 1993) seemed to  be effective at  this moment,

and at the same time, it echoed Kalsched (2013/2022). Cases referring to early trauma will state

that  they  were  "saved"  by  an  inner  world  filled  with  supernatural  beings  that  provided  an

archetypal place of containment for their innocent souls. But now, Xiao-Mei does not have to

imagine  the  inner  world  but  truly  embodies  the  power  of  being  saved  in  real  life.  Through

parent-child talks  between father  and daughter, it is  indeed possible to  achieve the effect  of

mutual communication and expression of ideas, and the presence of the researcher can be said

to  be  the  witness  of  both  parents  and  children  and  also  plays  the  role  of  bridge  and

communication.

202

During the interview, it was also explained that in the past, parents and children adopted a

relatively  one-way  communication  and  processing  model  because  they  did  not  have  good

opportunities and methods of expression. Most of them were the father's wishful thinking and

the client's crying resistance, which often caused misunderstandings between the two parties.

Currently,  through  the  interview,  this  is  an  opportunity  for  both  parties  to  communicate.  I

believe this is  just the beginning.  In the future,  continued communication will be needed to

enhance understanding between the two parties.

(4) Verify Again from the Understanding of Object Relationships

Winnicott (1960) described the relationship between mother and infant as a mind-body

companionship. Kalsched (2013/2022) also quoted Winnicott's mention of the sacred image of

the  mother-infant  duality,  which  further  elucidates  the  association  between  intimacy  and

closeness. Therefore, the close physical contact between mother and baby leads to the formation

of the baby's inner world, and the process of mind-body companionship then affects how an

individual  establishes  an  intimate  relationship  in  the  future.  The  client  in  this  study  lacked

nurturing  care  in  the  mother-baby  relationship.  Kalsched  (1996/2018)  quoted  Winnicott  as

saying that if the mother's care is erratic, highly stimulating, or often ignored, the individual's

true self will split into a false self to prematurely isolate the true self from the trauma. The case

in this study grew up in such a changing environment. The client would develop a false self to

protect himself and even deteriorate into physical and mental symptoms. In this study, the client

is in a mental state of major depression. Kalsched (2013/2022) even mentioned that depression

sucks the individual, making the individual feel that the mood no longer belongs to him but to

depression. Therefore, in this study, the client also projected her feelings of real or imaginary

mother's love and hate onto the researcher. The researcher received and adjusted this projection.

The  client  thus  became  more  relaxed  through  adjustment,  and  the  researcher,  through  the

feeling  of  love,  is  reintroduced,  and  a  transformative  relationship  is  formed  between  the

researcher and the client. The client develops a conscience and repairs the old damage with her

mother. This is how the process progresses back and forth.

  (5) Research Limitations and Future Prospects

The client in this study was accepted and tolerated through play therapy with a Jungian

psychoanalytic approach, transforming past trauma into blessings and generating the ability to

repair. In a new journey, let go of the depressed inner state of the past and instead be willing to

embrace an open process. When the client develops its sense of existence and meaning, it can

203

start again to find new goals in life. However, the researcher also found that not every client

can tell their impressive fairy tales or that the subjects of this study are keenly aware and can

self-analyze  in  the  later  stages  of  the  consultation.  Therefore,  it  is  recommended  that  in  the

future, such as painting and psychological drama can be carried out. Expressing inner thoughts

or  situations  through  catalytic  and  auxiliary  methods  can  also  help  clients  experience  their

feelings and be released from trauma. (Part of this paper was presented at the 5th Indigenous

Social Science Conference and the 6th Indigenous Counseling Psychology Conference)

台灣校園多元性別(cid:13687)群學生遭遇恐同經驗之探究

蔡雨澤  方嘉琦*

摘要

本研究目的為瞭解同志學生於台灣校園遭遇的恐同經驗，同志諮詢熱線協會（2021）

調查中指出校園環境仍無法讓同志學生感到安全，且恐同言論不僅來自同儕之間，教職

員也是其中一環，顯示在《性別平等教育法》實施至今 18 年的台灣校園仍然有相當大

的進步空間。本研究透過訪談台灣大專院校學生，探討台灣校園中恐同的樣貌，進一步

整理並歸納台灣校園的恐同現狀及呈現形式，以瞭解同志學生在校園中可能遭遇的恐同

經驗。本研究使用質性分析之主題分析法，對三位受訪者進行個別訪談。首先呈現三位

受訪者整理過後之主題，並接著描述主題下的次主題內容，最後進行綜合分析。本研究

結果發現同志學生於校園中經驗到的恐同經驗可分為：同志學生知覺到校園多元性別敏

感度不足、同志學生經驗到恐同行為、同志學生內化恐同的循環。整體來說，三位受訪

者在恐同行為皆提到微攻擊（microaggressions）的經驗，除了來自同儕也來自教職員，

並對於當時在探索性傾向及建立自我認同產生影響。於綜合討論中提出隱身台灣校園的

恐同經驗、同志學生的內化恐同現象及多元性別敏感度在校園的重要性，師長需具備多

元性別敏感度以協助同志學生，並更有機會覺察、辨識微攻擊的恐同行為。本研究關注

台灣校園中發生的恐同經驗，對於台灣校園同志學生處境有初步的探討，並認為多元性

別敏感度若能在校園中被重視，能夠使同儕更瞭解、接納同志學生；師長也能夠覺察校

園中可能存在的微攻擊現狀以協助同志學生。並以此研究做為拋磚引玉，期望更多教育

工作者與助人工作者看見、並重視此議題。

關鍵詞：本土化、多元性別敏感度、恐同、微攻擊

壹、前言

近年性別平等教育在校園中的實施仍被廣泛的討論，尤其以《性別平等教育法》實

施至今 18 年，校園環境是否因此法的頒布落實性別友善的校園環境？2017 年 5 月 24 日

大法官釋憲《司法院釋字第 748 號解釋》，釋字中提到同志婚姻權利應受到司法的保障

（司法院釋字第 748 號解釋施行法，2017），後年伴隨而來的 11 月 24 日公民投票，其

中第十四案「民法保障同性婚姻」以 67.26%的不同意比率與 32.74%的同意比率，宣佈

此案不通過；同樣未通過的還有第十五案「國中小性別平等教育明定入法」，該案不同

意票比率以 65.99%高於同意票比率 34.01%，宣佈此案不通過（中選會，2018）；2019

年 5 月 17 日立法院通過「司法院釋字第 748 號解釋施行法」，台灣正式成為亞洲第一

個同性婚姻合法的國家（立法院，2019），同志專法的通過為同志平權跨進了一大步，

但在社會還未完全接受同志的氛圍下，透過上述公投的數據以及法律的施行可發現，台

灣社會普遍不贊同同志婚姻及性別平等教育的實施，在法律率先定案的情況下造成了法

律與民意的不同調，同志的基本人權雖受到了法律的保障，卻也可能需要面對更多的社

會討論；社會、教育乃至校園中，很難隨著法律制度上的調整立即改變民眾對於同志(cid:13687)

群的接納程度，尤其在校園中因《性別平等教育法》的實施，校園看似趨近性別友善，

可校園中的性平事件仍層出不窮，張盈堃（2019）指出在公投後性別不友善延伸的校園

性霸淩越發明顯；台灣同志諮詢熱線協會（以下簡稱同志熱線）針對 13~18 歲青少年的

台灣同志（LGBTQ+）學生經驗調查報告（2021）顯示：台灣校園環境仍然無法讓同志

學生感到安全，且當同志學生遇到騷擾時普遍不敢尋求協助，台灣校園充斥偏見的言論，

且這些帶著歧視的言論不只來自於同儕也來自教職員，可見台灣校園對於同志學生的處

境仍有進步的空間。

張德勝、王采薇（2009，2010）和張德勝等（2013）大學生對同志態度的研究中指

出，大學生對於同志人權的保障大多採取支持的立場，然而回到人際關係層面討論對同

志學生的態度，在同志關係的接受程度無論是愛情、友情或是同情層面，接受層度皆偏

低，這樣子的轉變不由得使研究者思考，校園中同志學生在校園中會經驗何種的同儕關

係，是否如上述研究中發現的，看似接納同志學生的同志身份，卻在人際關係中仍然持

保留甚至不接納的態度；王大維等（2018）的研究中提及女同志學生在生活中所經驗的

性傾向微攻擊，同儕在日常生活中無意間透露了對於同志(cid:13687)群的排斥與不接納；同志熱

線（2021）的研究仍顯示同儕及教職員間仍有對於同志不友善的狀況，可見校園中的恐

同氛圍沒有明顯的改善。根據上述研究背景與動機，期望透過瞭解台灣校園學生在求學

過程經驗之恐同行為，藉由歸納受訪者的經驗整理出臺灣校園本土化的恐同型態。因此

本研究目的為：瞭解同志學生於台灣校園遭遇的恐同經驗。

211

貳、恐同的定義與社會恐同氛圍

一、恐同的內涵與社會恐同現狀

恐同（homophobia）一詞是由 George Weinberg 在 1967 年提出，他認為恐同是一種

非理性的厭惡—對於同志非理性的譴責（Weinberg, 1973）；而 Herek（2004）將恐同敵

意分為三個面向：性汙名（Sexual Stigma）、異性戀主義（Heterosexism）、性偏見（Sexual

Prejudice），恐同的意識形態透過文化及社會結構，使得大眾內化恐同意識，逐漸形塑

對同志的汙名化，進一步貶低、剝奪同志的權益。《汙名：管理受損身份的筆記》一書

也提及汙名具強大的貶抑效果，尤其是與我們個人屬性相衝突或是與刻板印象不符合時，

我們會下意識的對對方貼標籤，不與之接觸，進而將其孤立（Goffman, 1986/2010），龐

大的社會壓力使得同志群體感到窒息。

台灣文化中的同志(cid:13687)群在社會中需要小心自己的性傾向被揭露，以免因自身性取向

招致社會大眾汙名、標籤化，駱俊宏等（2005）在研究中指出，因社會在異性戀霸權、

父權體制下，透過汙名化及標籤化的過程，否定了同志(cid:13687)群存在的事實，而這樣的社會

背景也建構了一個抗拒及歧視同志的社會環境；又如上述對於恐同的描述，同志身份被

汙名化為錯誤、不道德等，透過汙名化的過程進而否定同志存在的應然性（Swigonski,

2006）；而在社會上異性戀被視為「正常」的基礎上，所有人被假定為異性戀，直到同

志身份揭露（Haddad, 2019）。

而在社會中受挫的同志在家庭中也無法訴說自身的困境，台灣家庭在傳統儒家文化

的影響下，對於同志(cid:13687)群的性傾向、性別氣質接納態度較為保守，王素真等（2014）於

研究中指出，民眾對於同志態度有所保留但是並不鼓勵，而約 6 成的民眾會教育自身子

女不要成為同志；約 5 成的民眾表示，若是自己的子女為同志，會導正性傾向，若子女

的性傾向無法導正，則會反對同志子女發展感情。因同志子女的身份挑戰了傳統夫妻價

值，而這樣的挑戰違反了道德臉面的性道德行為（朱瑞鈴，1991），而華人文化中的臉

面共用原則，則會連帶使家庭受到道德上的評價（韓貴香、李美枝，2011），如此在社

會中、家庭中來回不斷的負向評價，使得同志(cid:13687)群在日常生活有著龐大的壓力，進而影

響同志(cid:13687)群的身心健康。

駱俊宏等（2005）研究中提到，若是想要改善同志於社會中汙名化的現象需要從教

育著手，然而校園中的性別平等教育的實施，卻是充滿荊棘。2014 年同志熱線召開的「性

平教育淪黑箱，友善多元剩口號—《性別平等教育法》實施十週年總體檢」記者會，提

到了性別平等教育在 10 年中不進反退，性別教育如同燙手山芋，因中央及地方政府的

政策不同調讓性別平等教育寸步難行，更使得校園環境的不友善被法律掩蓋，《性別平

等教育法》反而成為了維持校園多元友善的假像；而當教師投身性別平等教育課程時，

212

受到家長團體的投訴及阻撓，使得教師在教學中左右為難，更造成了教育界中人人噤若

寒蟬，王儷靜（2019）認為這樣的現狀影響了教師的教學專業，因這樣的社會氛圍影響，

使得同志在校園中的處境不甚樂觀。

二、校園中恐同的不同樣態

Wright 等（1999）將恐同分成三個構念，「認知」、「情感」、「行為」。在認知

構念上，George Smith 於 2005 年提出「變態死 gay」意識形態，透過此意識形態排擠、

孤立同志學生，並強調性別刻板印象，強化了異性戀霸權的主流文化，同志學生在校園

中須小心維持異性戀的角色，透過維持性別刻板印象的表像避免自己成為「箭靶」，招

致同儕的攻擊。2010 年陳曼君在高中職的研究提到，弱勢學生具備多元性別的相關知識，

接納程度就越高；反之若是不具備多元性別相關知識（含性別刻板印象），則對同志的

接納程度越低，可見多元性別教育在教育中的重要性。

在情感層面上，如張德勝和王采薇（2009，2010，2013）大學生對同志態度的研究

中指出，大學生對於同志人權的保障大多採取支持的立場，而回到與情感相關的人際關

係、愛情、友情與同情等面向，則接受度偏低；陳曼君（2010）的研究結果則提到學生

對於同志學生的認識程度越低，則接納程度越低，反之亦然，兩者的研究結果可以看出，

具備多元性別知識對於學生接納同志(cid:13687)群是相當重要的因素，認知層面影響了同儕的接

納程度，兩個層面息息相關。

在行為構念方面，Horn 與 Nucci（2003）提到同志學生經常在校園中經歷同儕的恐

同行為；Smith（2005）也提及同儕以語言霸淩、排擠、騷擾等方式對待同志學生；Sue

等（2007）歸納微攻擊為以下三種類型：微侵犯（microassault），指透過語言或是非語

言訊息傳達貶低的態度及訊息，是較明顯的歧視或是偏見，如語言上的侮辱或行為上的

刻意迴避；微冒犯（microinsult），通常為無意識的攻擊，意即無攻擊意圖但其內容貶低

某 (cid:13687) 群 的 認 同 及 文 化 ， 或 是 沒 有 敏 感 到 此 言 行 貶 低 對 他 人 身 份 或 認 同 ； 微 無 視

（microinvalidation），指無意識的排除特定群體，或是不認為社會對其有壓迫或是差別

待遇，貶低特定(cid:13687)群所經驗、理解的現實。而 Sue（2010）提出了性傾向微攻擊（sexual

orientation microaggressions），在日常生活中以口語、行為和環境中的攻擊形式，無論有

意無意，對多元性別(cid:13687)群表露貶低、敵意或輕視的現象。無論外顯或是內隱的恐同行為，

皆構成了校園對同志不友善的環境，同時也讓同志學生在校園的生活須提心吊膽、步步

為營的隱藏自身同志身份，這樣危機四伏的校園環境也影響了同志學生的身心健康。

由上述文獻中可得知，校園中的恐同意識形態對同志(cid:13687)群造成了許多傷害，除了人

際關係上的排擠、肢體上的攻擊，如台灣伴侶權益推動聯盟「同志壓力處境問卷」中顯

示，高達 58％的同志受訪者曾受到他人不同形式的傷害，傷害的形式以語言暴力為主，

213

占了百分比中的  91％，其次的人際排擠為 54％（簡至潔，2012）；而同志學生在校園

中受到恐同行為相關傷害，而導致其在校園中感到不安全，進而影響同志學生的校園適

應。例如同志熱線（2021）數據指出，35.6%的同志學生對校園感到不安全，並有 49.9%

的同志學生表示想要逃避校園集會（朝會、運動會）；4.9%的同志學生在過去一個月內

曾經缺席至少一天，7.6%的同志學生曾經轉過學，嚴重影響同志學生的校園生活。相差

近 10 年的調查，恐同的事件仍然在校園中發生，顯示了校園中營造性別平等及性別友

善之停滯，值得重視此議題。

綜上所述，瞭解台灣校園中發生的恐同行為是值得重視的議題，從法律與社會層面

而言，在法律保障同志人權的情況下造成了法律與公投結果的落差；而校園中藉由台灣

伴侶權益推動聯盟（簡至潔，2012）及同志熱線（2021）研究中，可以窺見同志(cid:13687)群在

校園中面臨的困境。由於台灣本土對於校園中同志(cid:13687)群遭遇恐同經驗的研究較少，本研

究期望透過一窺校園中同志學生所經歷的恐同經驗，豐富國內研究，以期更好的協助同

志學生面對困境。

參、 研究方法

一、資料蒐集及研究工具

本研究為瞭解同志學生於校園中遭遇恐同事件的經驗，以個別訪談的方式蒐集資料，

透過受訪者分享校園中恐同之相關經驗，瞭解校園中恐同的呈現形式。本研究訪談採半

結構式訪談，以訪談大綱為主軸，與受訪者進行深度訪談。訪談大綱主題包含：

1.  瞭解同志學生在校園中經歷多元性別敏感度的經驗

2.  瞭解同志學生在校園中經歷內化恐同的經驗

3.  瞭解同志學生在校園中經歷恐同行為的經驗

本研究招募受訪者進行條件的初篩，初篩的內容包含：

1.  確認受訪者基本資料

2.  初步瞭解受訪者欲分享經驗

3.  澄清受訪者對研究之疑問

透過初篩確認受訪者有足夠之經驗滿足訪談資料蒐集，也藉由初篩的機會與受訪者

建立信任關係，釐清受訪者對於研究之疑慮以及說明保密與知後同意原則，確認受訪者

藉由初篩瞭解研究目的、自身權益及參與研究意願。

訪談過程中研究者中立、客觀的詢問，避免研究者價值觀影響受訪者分享內容，期

望受訪者能暢所欲言；若是有離題之狀況，研究者適時提醒受訪者，並將話題引導回主

214

題上。訪談中全程錄音，錄音檔的內容僅提供此研究及研究者碩士論文使用，受訪者個

人資料及可辨識身份訊息，將會匿名處理或是以代號的方式呈現。

研究工具亦包含研究者本身，研究者本身為同志(cid:13687)群，身處校園當中不免感受到校

園中仍有些對於同志的不友善，以及身(cid:13673)朋友的相關經驗做為研究發想，更近一步討論

校園中恐同的現狀；且研究者對於同志(cid:13687)群議題有相當的熱忱並持續關注，身為同志(cid:13687)

群更能以貼近受訪者的視角做更深入的訪談。指導教授同為協同分析者，具諮商專業領

域之專業知能、實務工作經驗與學術研究，同樣遵循隱私和倫理規定，提供研究方法及

資料分析的釐清與檢核，尤其在分析資料的過程中協助研究者檢視逐字稿，核對編碼資

本研究以立意取樣招募三位研究參與者，個別訪談時間約 1.5～2 個小時，以蒐集研

究參與者相關經驗。篩選標準有三：

1.  20～28 歲。限定該年齡層除了考量到參與者的成年與否外，也考量了超過 28 歲之

受訪者因世代差異可能受社會經驗影響，造成資料蒐集的偏誤，故將年齡層限定在

20～28 歲且仍在台灣校園就學之學生；有 4 人填寫報名表單，一位因年齡超過 28

歲，因此未邀請至訪談階段，故訪談三位受訪者。

2.  台灣大專院校就讀之學生。三位受訪者皆為台灣國籍，且求學環境皆在台灣，經驗

分享也皆為台灣校園中親身經歷及觀察。

3.  在校園中自身或是周遭有經歷恐同相關經驗。

本研究在透過網路平臺與入班招募受訪者，邀請與對研究主題有興趣並符合條件之

受訪者，三位受訪者摘要表如表 1。

三、資料分析

本研究選取質性研究設計，相對於大規模的量化研究，質性研究可以通過細致的紀

錄、深入的訪談和觀察等方法，捕捉到更多的細節和背後的意義，且能夠研究少數群體、

特定情境或特殊事件，提供獨特的視角和觀點，並探索不同觀點和經驗的多樣性；研究

者亦能夠納入社會互動、文化背景和個人經驗等因素，從而更好地理解和解釋研究結果。

本研究以主題分析方法進行逐字稿之分析，透過熟悉資料、編碼、尋求初步主題、

修正調整主題、界定主題的目的與意義等步驟，最後完成逐字稿之整理（吳啟誠、張瓊

雲，2020），輔以訪談大綱的主題之擬定，將訪談蒐集到之資料加以統整、歸納，為考

慮研究之準確性，整理逐字稿時與指導教授與協同分析者進行交叉檢核，並藉此避免研

究者同為同志身份之價值觀干涉研究結果之呈現，以降低研究者偏誤提高資料分析的可

信度。

四、研究倫理

研究者亦於 2019 年參與臺灣學術倫理教育資源中心共計 30 小時的課程、2020 年

中區研究倫理工作坊共計 3 小時，且在研究過程中恪遵研究倫理。為確保受訪者之福祉

及相關權利，個別訪談前研究者與受訪者閱讀參與研究同意書，說明研究主題、目的、

訪談耗時、錄音許可、保密、保密例外等受訪者權利，且說明在訪談期間受訪者有停止

分享並退出訪談之權利，在訪談過程中若是有不願意回答與分享的題目，也可保持沉默。

為確保訪談空間之隱密性，地點安排於所就讀學校之個別諮商空間，訪談過程全程保密，

在研究結果呈現中所有的個人資料與提及的相關資料匿名並以代號取代之。訪談過程中

受訪者需述說自身生命經驗，若在過程中受訪者有較大的情緒波動，會給予適當的休息

時間以及情緒支持，並在訪談結束後評估受訪者情緒狀態，並且提供可以尋求支援之相

關管道，三位受訪者皆未出現此情形。

肆、研究結果

圖 1 呈現歸納三位受訪者訪談逐字稿之主題及次主題，同志學生知覺到校園多元性

別敏感度不足、同志學生經驗到恐同行為、同志學生內化恐同的循環三者呈現訪談資料

及次主題內容，最後針對三位研究參與者做綜合分析及討論。

216

圖 1

歸納恐同經驗之主題及次主題概念

一、同志學生知覺校園多元性別敏感度不足

此主題包含了同志學生感受到同儕接納程度低、同志學生知覺師長不具備多元性別

知能、校園體制與資源缺乏讓同志學生感到不友善三者。藉由分析訪談逐字稿，當同儕

對於多元性別知能不足時，面對同志學生以迴避、疏離的方式對待同志學生；而師長未

具有多元性別知能時，無法覺察同志學生的困境，也無法提供同志學生即時的協助，何

況師長本身在校園中為具有權力的角色，當師長未覺察此情形，自身起到了示範的榜樣，

無形中也維持了異性戀主流文化的架構，兩者互相影響下使得同志學生在校園的處境愈

加艱難。

（一）同志學生感受到同儕的接納程度低

受訪者皆提到同儕對於自身性別氣質與性傾向的接納程度，尤其在求學階段中同儕

對於同志學生的接納程度意義深遠，當同儕對同志學生不瞭解時，容易與同志學生保持

距離並疏遠同志學生。

217

（國小）可能就是男生要某個樣子、女生要某個樣子，那像我比較中間或比較

娘的就不能被，也許私下可以是朋友但檯面上就好像不行。（H014）

（國中）就是這個身份，好像阻止了我跟很多人去建立關係。（P029）

（二）同志學生知覺師長不具備多元性別知能

受訪者的經驗中皆提及師長的態度，當師長不具多元性別知能時，在教學、教育會

帶入異性戀主流的意識，使同志學生接收到自己與他人不同的訊息，更嚴重的言論會直

接提及非異性戀就是有問題、需要被導正的。T 的經驗中提到，當師長迴避多元性別話

題時，會使得同志學生擔心師長的看法，導致在求助上須顧慮師長如何看待同志學生的

身份；P 則是回憶自身當時在校園中與同儕發生衝突時，師長很快地將 P 認定為性傾向

出了問題，而非同儕間的打鬧，覺察老師當時的言論相當偏頗。

師長不具備多元性別知能也需要注意到師長本身具備的權力位階，當師長不具備多

元性別知能且未覺察到自身角色具備權力時，會因為權力位階的不對等對同志學生造成

更大的傷害，H 的經驗中提到自身求助經驗，因師長無法回應 H 的疑問，且因師長的權

威角色，加深了 H 對於同志身份的恐懼。

（國中）他就只是在問我說那你就是有做了什麼行為之類的，你有跟網友怎樣

怎樣，我覺得他讓我真的覺得大家在社會上就是很恐同，我覺得那個老師也是

很驚訝，這好像真的是生平第一次有學生跟他講這件事情，他好像也沒有這個

背景跟知能，所以也沒有給我一些支持跟幫助。我那一次去我真的覺得是一個

蠻錯誤的決定，因為他也沒有給我什麼幫助然後也害我、也更害怕他可能會去

洩漏或怎樣的，或者是他怎麼看我。（H046）

其實老師不太會公開講這個話題，然後如果真的是像是班導要去跟他做詢問或

者是討論自己性取向的話，真的就會擔心老師會怎麼看你，然後我自己覺得老

師比較像是會迴避這個話題，不管是年輕的或者是老的老師，除非是真的很開

放的老師，不然其實他們就會是閃避這個話題。（T021）

（國小）因為他說的不是我做這件事情不正確，他的意思是這個人的性傾向是

不對勁的，我當時很困惑，就是我以為我是來被罵，我做了一件不對的事情，

可是為什麼指向了我的狀態不對，我的性傾向不對。（P024）

（三）校園體制與資源缺乏讓同志學生感到不友善

218

國小、國中到高中的師長缺乏具備多元性別敏感度維持了異性戀主流的校園氛圍，

而同儕受到此氛圍影響加深了同志學生未符合傳統性別價值觀，兩者互相交織形成了校

園中對同志不友善的環境。受訪者表示在國、高中階段校園環境未能提供認識、討論多

元性別的空間，也未能建立讓同志學生感到安全的校園環境，到了大學才發現原來校園

可以討論多元性別議題。尤其 T 在訪談中提到，大學以前的校園很少有機會接觸到關於

性平的相關活動，使得同志學生在校園中沒有足夠的資源因應自身對於自身身份的困惑；

而 P 提到在這樣的校園氛圍中，讓 P 在校園中無法感到安全並且深受其擾。

（國中）其實我們學校裡面的氛圍就不會特意去講這樣就是講性別平等這件事

情，應該跟其他學校差不多吧，就是因為那個教約的關係，所以他不會特意去

宣傳性別平等、不要歧視這樣子，只是學生之間自己就會知道這件事情就是這

樣。（T004）

（高中）對我來說，那就是一個當時我的狀況，然後這些事情其實說實在話，

他就是生活上小到不能再小的事情，可是它佔滿了我的高中生活，我的高中生

活幾乎沒有一刻，讓我覺得在學校裡面是安全的。（P008）

二、同志學生經驗到恐同行為

本主題整理了三位受訪者提及之恐同行為分類：外顯攻擊與微攻擊兩者。分析過程

中可以歸納出明顯、外顯的恐同行為，隨著求學階段的不同慢慢轉為較隱微、難以察覺

的微攻擊形式，對同志學生來說微攻擊遍佈在日常的玩笑、遊戲中，也許有意也許無意

的被提及。正因微攻擊較難辨認及覺察，因此即使同志學生處於在微攻擊的氛圍中，同

儕及師長不一定能夠覺察此現象，而是合理地認為這些微攻擊是再平常不過的言論及行

為。

（一）同志學生經驗外顯攻擊

外顯攻擊為較容易辨識的恐同行為，透過語言、肢體、關係等方式對待同志學生，

影響同志學生在校園中人際關係與校園適應，尤其是語言攻擊，三位受訪者皆提到對於

語言攻擊已經「麻痺」、「習慣了」，可見在求學過程中同志學生飽受語言攻擊之苦，

只能以忽略、習慣來面對這樣的困境；肢體攻擊主要為 H 分享之經驗，在國中時同儕以

肢體攻擊的方式彰顯「男子氣概」，認為不符合男性氣質的 H 應該被「懲罰」；關係攻

219

擊指藉由拉攏其他同儕，以排擠同志學生，透過人際關係對同志學生造成人際上的疏離

及壓力，下述依序呈現訪談資料。

1.  語言攻擊

語言攻擊為常見的恐同行為，身為同志學生，H、T 表示聽得太多甚至都已經麻痺

了，同志學生在求學過程中被迫習慣這些語言上的攻擊，彷彿不在意，這些言論卻結結

實實地在同志學生的生活、心靈造成或大或小的傷害，有關語言攻擊的例子(cid:13687)繁不及備

載，此處主要呈現受訪者提及之資訊。

（國小）然後就開始一直講，就是很淪為大家的話柄的那種感覺，然後就會一

直嘲笑我，然後就會覺得我很噁心啊，就會那種言語攻擊的感覺。（H027）

開玩笑這種有點語言霸淩這種都是多少少都會發生，不過我自己覺得那個傷害

好像比較小一點吧，習慣(cid:1291)自然嘛。（T009）

（高中）例如像是男生之前，可能就是會有打球啊之類的，那如果有人狀態不

好。他可能就會罵他說：『你是不是昨天去賣屁股？』所以今天表現不好，只

是他們會給我這種感覺，就是他們比較歧視，他們是直接把這件事情當作是一

個罵人或者是開玩笑的素材這樣。（T017）

2.  性霸淩

H 於訪談中提及較明顯的肢體攻擊，於國中時期男性同儕透過肢體攻擊展現對於 H

性別氣質的不接納，並透過「懲罰」的方式表示若是不符合性別期待應受到此對待，就

由此行為強化了性別刻板印象及校園對同志不友善的氛圍，而 H 提及的肢體攻擊是相

當帶有性意味的攻擊，透過這樣的方式以性貶低同志學生。

（國中）可能那個男生就不爽，那他就會找一群男生來，他們覺得說要強暴我

這樣，但可是沒有到真的就是弄到身體的裸露，但就是一群人把你壓住或是說

就是弄你啊，反正就是我自己的一群男生壓住我或幹嘛就真的沒有辦法反抗。

（H024）

（國中）國一大家男生有時候可能廁所要排隊，然後都只有小便，所以有時候

要排，就不敢在很多人的時候去，或是偶爾他們會興致一來，或是突然想到什

220

麼就會想到說我們來看一下娘炮的屌之類的，然後就會開始要來看你或者是把

你的褲子脫下來或之類的。（H040）

3.  關係攻擊

受訪者 T 則提及當自身同志身份被揭露後，在同儕的相處上變得更需要小心翼翼，

擔心同儕會跟其他人講自身的性傾向，拉攏其他的學生以異樣的眼光看待Ｔ。

（高中）那我在跟他們相處的時候，我就會覺得特別有壓力，就是講話要特別

小心，不知道他們會不會又一個看我不順眼，然後又在全年級講我的壞話這樣。

（T014）

（二）同志學生經驗到微攻擊

在微攻擊的部分三位元受訪者的內容皆提到豐富的資訊，無論是 H 提到的：同志是

異類應該被歸納在一起，以異性戀主流的方式，分類了同志(cid:13687)群；又如同 T 在訪談中提

及自身被迫出櫃的經驗，即使校園可能是友善的，但同儕忽略了出櫃對同志學生可能造

成的壓力及招致他人不友善眼光；而在 P 的親身經驗中，同志學生被拿來成為大冒險的

素材最為深刻，透過玩笑、遊戲的方式，實則展現了對同志學生的敵意及輕視，而這樣

的開玩笑的素材卻是同志學生活生生的生活經驗。以下將受訪者提及之經驗分類為：同

志學生經驗到惡意的歧視行為、同志學生經驗到自身身份被分類及貶低、同志學生經驗

到自身經驗及感受被否定等三點呈現資料。

1.  同志學生經驗到惡意的歧視行為

P 的經驗中同儕以大冒險的方式貶低 P 的同志身份，將與 P 握手當成大冒險的遊

戲，傳達了 P 是他們不願意接觸的對象，使 P 感受到了同儕將他視為噁心的人，藉由遊

戲的方式包裝了對他人實質的貶抑行為，傷害了同志學生。

（高中）在遊覽車上有一群同學在遊戲，他們也知道我的同志身份，突然有一

個男生來問我，可不可以跟他握手？然後我就說 OK，我就跟他握手這樣子，然

後他們後面的人在拍照錄影這樣。然後我才知道一件事情，這是他們的大冒險，

就是大冒險，他們的大冒險的內容是來握我的手。（P013）

2.  同志學生經驗到自身身份被分類及貶低

三位受訪者皆提到在校園中同儕可能下意識地將同志學生分為一類，自認自身接納、

尊重同志學生的身份及認同，卻下意識地將自己與同志學生劃分成兩個群體，未意識到

221

這樣的分類貶低了同志學生的認同及身份；或是在日常生活中以同志(cid:13687)群作為玩笑及議

論的素材，雖然對象不一定是同志學生，但同志學生仍感到自己的身份不被尊重，自己

的身份與認同是可以被當成玩笑或是議論的話題。

（高中）對他們來說好像是一個很異類，那你們是異類就應該被歸類在一起，

異類就應該要互相喜歡這樣子，這真的是很、很糟糕的感覺。（H060）

就是我自己聽到還蠻多人會講，說：『就是你是同性戀 OK，可是不要發生在我

身上。』會還蠻多人講這樣，不管是國中高中甚至到大學，其實還是還蠻多人

會這樣子，他們也不會說歧視什麼的，但他們就是會說：『他們尊重但不希望

發生在我身上這樣。』他們就是他們會表明他們是異性戀。（T005）

（高中）他們就會說：『哎，你知道嗎？那個誰誰誰他是同性戀耶』，那另外

一個人就會說：『哦，真的假的。』反正那個時候就比較像是在嘲諷的感覺。

高一的時候，的確會因為這件事，就是因為被迫出櫃，這件事情讓我受到一些

影響，我自己會覺得很不安，就是很提心吊膽，就是很擔心自己的性向被知道

之後會不會發生些什麼事情。（T013、T018）

（高中）大家就會覺得性別氣質、性傾向是一件可以被拿來開玩笑的事情，但

他們從來沒有想到他們所開的這些玩笑，他們拿來開玩笑用的這些素材，他們

覺得噁心的這些素材，是我們活生生的生活。（P020）

3.  同志學生經驗到自身經驗及感受被否定

P 的經驗中則是同儕在談話過程中忽視了同志(cid:13687)群的存在，認為同志(cid:13687)群人數「沒

這麼多」，無意中忽視了同志(cid:13687)群的存在必然性，而 P 則經驗到自己同志身份或是同志

(cid:13687)群的存在是被否定的。

（大學）他那個時候說了一句話，他說他不覺得這個世界上的同志有這麼多。

作為同志的我，我會有一種感覺是這個空氣在排外，就是某種程度上在否認我

們真的有這麼多人的存在，他那句話說出來的時候，整個就是給我一種感覺，

就是他會讓我覺得也許不是我，但有其他的同志的存在其實是被否認的。（P038）

三、同志學生內化恐同的循環

222

受訪者提及有關性別刻板印象的概念，當校園中維持了異性戀主流的架構，同志學

生將內化性別刻板印象，形成內化恐同，將校園內的攻擊及批評導向自身，影響同志探

索及發展自我認同；而內化恐同的同志學生也會轉而不接納、甚至攻擊其他同志學生，

因著這樣的內化恐同的循環成為了恐同環境的一部分。

（一）同志學生內化恐同且轉而不接納其他同志學生

同儕要求同志學生應符合性別期待，同志學生在接受這些評價時除了受到批評的壓

力外，也影響自身對於性別氣質、性傾向的認同；恐同的環境使得同志學生除了學習到

傳統的性別框架外，更是潛移默化了非異性戀主流文化皆為異類的想法，在校園中日復

一日生活的同志學生逐漸內化恐同，這樣的內化恐同不僅阻礙了同志學生在性傾向上的

探索，也讓同志學生在建立自我認同的道路上困難重重，如 H 在訪談中提及，因同儕的

不接納及不認同，使得 H 也不想承認自己的同志身份，同志學生因此內化了性別刻板印

象。

（國中）可能以前我們都恐同嘛，我也覺得我也是這樣子，但我不會把它說出

來，就我可能知道我自己是同性戀，而且我記得我在國中印象深刻，是我覺得

自己很怪，然後我覺得自己可能是生病了這樣，因為就沒有這樣的案例出現，

對，所以就是那時候自己也很害怕，然後認同也是這樣。（H042）

（高中）就是不想承認自己是同志學生，然後也不想要這樣子出櫃，然後也不

會想要去跟那個可能是同志學生的朋友當朋友。因為就覺得大家會把我歸類(cid:1291)

同志學生，你們都是同志學生，你們都是 gay，然後就會覺得這是一件很不好

的事情，所以我自己很排斥這件事。（H056）

內化了性別刻板印象的同志學生，除了對於自身身份感到矛盾、困惑，也將這樣的

內化恐同概念轉向不接納其他同志學生，認為其他同志學生也應該隱藏自身特質；若是

其他同志學生表現出自身的同志身份，會藉由攻擊的方式表達同志學生不應該表現出同

志身份。H 訪談就提及國中時會覺得同志就應該隱姓埋名，不應該展現自己的性傾向，

自己也真的有可能以攻擊的方式，打壓太過展現自身特質的同志學生。

（高中）我就會覺得，我就會類似想要去有點像攻擊他，就會覺得說他好怪，

他怎麼敢這麼明目張膽或者是這麼敢出櫃，他這樣子好像不太 OK、好像不太好，

就是可能再更不能接受的話，可能就真的會攻擊他的性傾向，雖然自己也是但

因為我自己不敢去這樣子表現，可能就是他可以是同志學生，但他不可以這樣

223

子，因為同志學生就應該要隱姓埋名地過生活，是不應該這樣子直接表現出來、

不能夠被發現、不能被大家知道、不能這麼強調自己的身份。就是這件事情應

該要被藏起來這樣子，就是不要被發現。（H065）

伍、綜合討論

一、隱身台灣校園的恐同經驗

本研究在分析的結果中，覺察無論同志學生遭遇恐同經驗，在校園中彷彿被視為常

態、習以為常的事件，就像是在隱身校園中被忽視。本研究在分析過程中觀察到，國小、

國中及高中的恐同現狀可能與發展階段有關，訪談中國小的恐同行為主要來自對於多元

性別學生的不理解延伸的疏離及排斥；國中階段開始對於性好奇，也反映在 H 經驗當中

以性意味為主的恐同行為；高中甚至大學，以較隱微的、內隱的形式，如研究結果中多

元性別學生經驗到微攻擊經驗。因此研究者假設隨著就學階段的不同恐同行為從外顯的、

易辨識的恐同行為逐漸轉變了在日常生活中以玩笑、遊戲的方式，隱含了對同志學生的

忽視及貶低，這樣觀察與假設未來需進一步研究求證。王大維等（2018）的研究中的三

位女同志受訪者皆表示當受到微攻擊時，共同感受到不舒服及生氣，而這些看似無傷大

雅、無關緊要的小小玩笑，卻是同志學生每天都需承受的日常生活。

本研究亦發現，受訪者在針對微攻擊的經驗分享上較為困難，相較於明顯的「歧視」，

微攻擊的概念對於同志學生來說較為陌生，受訪者有時感受到不舒服也會不免浮現是自

己想太多的念頭，是研究中需要克服的部分，因此需要更精確的定義及解釋微攻擊概念

才能更深入瞭解多元性別學生在校園中的困境。此外，在性傾向微攻擊的討論中，本研

究發現台灣對於多元性別學生在校園中的恐同經驗討論甚少，Diana  與 Kim（2022）於

香港的研究中提到教育人士及專業人士須考量到獨特的文化影響，如同國外以宗教、種

(cid:13687)歧視等觀點切入討論有關性傾向微攻擊，特別提及學校性教育及學校專業人員培訓的

重要性。

校園中若是沒有足夠的理解及充分的關注微攻擊，微攻擊則將繼續損害受迫害者之

生活及生活水準（Nadal, 2018; Williams et al., 2021）。而當師長、同儕不具多元性別敏

感度時，這些玩笑不曾被重視，甚至師長未覺察到微攻擊的現象，無意間默認了微攻擊

的合理性，合理了同儕以同志學生的身份作為玩笑素材的行為，而同志學生也難以向他

人求助。日常生活中的微攻擊，如空氣裡的千斤重擔，在同志學生的校園生活中無處不

在，同志學生暴露在此氛圍中無所遁形，卻鮮少人覺察此現象。而台灣對於性傾向微攻

擊則須考量到台灣文化、法律制度、社會氛圍等因素如何影響校園，以更瞭解台灣校園

學生於校園中將面對何種挑戰，才能更好的協助台灣校園學生，並期望同志學生在求學

224

階段能夠自由的探索不同的可能性，而非如同身陷囹圄的火烈鳥，囿於傳統文化的框架

中，在建立自我認同的過程中受到汙名化及其延伸恐同行為影響，而造成同志學生身心

及學習權益受損。

二、同志學生的內化恐同

在研究結果中可以發現，若是同志學生身處充滿微攻擊而無法向師長求助的校園環

境中，同志學生的校園生活將進退維谷且處境艱辛，對同志學生的性傾向的探索、自我

認同更是步履維艱。恐同的環境使得同志學生除了學習到傳統的性別框架外，更是潛移

默化了非異性戀主流文化皆為異類的想法，在校園中日復一日生活的同志學生逐漸的內

化恐同（internalized homophobia），邱志軒（2019）將內化恐同描述為同志將外在環境

對同志的敵意及攻擊導向自身，導致對自身自我價值的貶低及不良的自我概念，使同志

自身身份產生矛盾、困惑甚至不接納。而這樣的內化恐同不僅阻礙了同志學生在性傾向

上的探索，也讓同志學生在建立自我認同的道路上困難重重，如同研究結果中 H 內化了

性別刻板印象及對同志的攻擊與敵意，基於這樣的內化恐同阻礙了自身自我認同的發展。

而性少數(cid:13687)群壓力與內化恐同兩者與憂鬱症狀也呈現正相關（Liang & Huang, 2021），

內化恐同不只對於多元性別(cid:13687)群心理健康造成負面影響，同志學生也因內化恐同因素不

接納同志(cid:13687)群同儕，這樣的內化恐同的循環使得對同志的敵意環境更加強大。

三、多元性別敏感度的重要性

本研究參考 Sue 等（2007）提出的多元文化諮商概念，認為校園也應重視師生對於

「覺察」、「知識」、「技巧」三者的訓練，建立師生對於多元性別學生的文化、價值

觀與偏見有覺察的能力。若同儕不具多元性別敏感度時，對同志學生多採取迴避、排斥

的態度，使得同志學生在校園的人際關係受到自身同志身份影響，不僅使得同志在校園

中人際支持不夠也進而影響同志學生對自身身份的認同；除了同儕的態度，師長身為在

校園中具有權力的角色，更為重要，若是師長不具備多元性別敏感度，無法在教育中以

客觀的態度帶領學生瞭解多元性別氣質與性傾向，遑論當同志學生遭遇微攻擊時，師長

能夠敏察同志學生的處境給予協助。如同志諮詢熱線協會（2021）的報告中提及，校園

未能處理偏見言論可能傳遞恐同行為可被容忍的訊息，而師長未察覺微攻擊的行為更是

潛移默化了微攻擊行為的合理性，在這些因素的相互交織影響下，校園成了默許恐同行

為的溫床，師長維持了恐同行為的架構，而同儕成為了恐同行為的劊子手，同志學生暴

露在恐同氛圍的校園環境，如同牢籠一般網住了同志學生的童年，在此引用受訪者 P 於

訪談中對師長之呼籲：

225

不作為，尤其是權力上的不作為，某種程度上，它就是維持了這個架構。（P043）

陸、研究結論與建議

一、結論

本研究針對三位受訪者之訪談資料之分析，於綜合討論提出了三點：同志學生知覺

校園多元性別敏感度不足、同志學生經驗到恐同行為、同志學生內化恐同的循環，期望

補充現有關於校園性傾向微攻擊的研究。研究三位受訪者就學背景《性別平等教育法》

已實施將逾 10 年，而受訪者的經驗中，國高中小的求學環境對於多元性別的討論仍相

當受限，直到大學校園氛圍才轉為較為開放的討論，這樣的校園環境使得同志教育出現

斷層，在高中以下要討論性別平等議題難如登天，而求學階段卻是同志學生急需資源的

階段，如同 H 在國中因性別氣質遭受肢體攻擊的經驗，與陳品妤（2021）研究中提及男

同志在國中階段感受多為負面經驗，且容易遭受肢體的霸淩與攻擊結果相同，而這些不

利經驗皆影響同志學生的自我認同，若是等到大學才接觸性別平等相關資源，恐怕為時

已晚。

二、建議

（一）對校園恐同行為特定面向進一步研究

如同本研究中綜合討論提到，多元性別學生在校園中遭受微攻擊、多元系別性暴力

等議題容易被忽視，而校園生活對多元性別學生的影響深遠，包含人際關係、內化恐同、

自我認同等，都需要更多的人關注到此議題，因此建議未來研究可以關注到上述議題，

更深入且仔細的看到校園中恐同行為的樣態，以提供實務工作者更多豐富資訊，以完整

此議題的專業建議。

（二）對實務工作者之建議

蔣琬斯、游美惠（2022）研究中提到性別平等教育只看見同性戀的窘境，教師們對

於性少數(cid:13687)群的認識侷限在同性戀性傾向，而忽略其他性少數(cid:13687)群，實務工作者應多瞭

解及認識不同性傾向的樣態以協助同志學生可能面對的困境。本研究亦認為建立多元性

別學生友善的校園環境，師長扮演重要的角色，對於師長而言，能夠覺察在校園中發生

的性傾向微攻擊氛圍，進而協助多元性別學生，且在教育的過程中能夠反思自身是否帶

入傳統文化價值觀，影響學生們對於多元性別的認識，最重要的是師長是否意識到自身

226

為校園中的權力代表，謹慎的在教學過程中以客觀的態度討論多元性別，以免自身成為

恐同行為的示範角色。

關於多元性別遭遇微攻擊相關議題，校園應建立友善及開放的認識多元性別的空間，

並注意校園中潛藏的微攻擊行為，藉由覺察、知識及技巧的學習反思校園中可能的恐同

行為。性教育方面也應融合多元性別性教育的知識，提供符合多元性別學生的性教育資

An Exploration of the Homophobic Experiences of LGBTQ+ Students in
Taiwan Campuses

Yu-Tse Tsai  Chia-Chi Fang＊

Abstract

The  main  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  understand  the  homophobic  experiences  of

LGBTQ+ students in Taiwan campus. Taiwan Tongzhi (LGBTQ+) Hotline Association (2021)

published a survey which pointed out that LGBTQ+ students are still fail to feel safe in campus,

and homophobic remarks not only comes from peers, but also faculty members, these findings

from the previous survey shows that since《Gender Equity Education Act》  first promulgated

and had executed over 20 years, Taiwanese campus still have a long way to go to reach gender

friendliness.  This  research  explores  the  forms  of  homophobia  in  Taiwanese  campuses  by

interviewing students from universities in Taiwan, then further organizes and summarizes the

data  to  describe  the  current  situation  and  presentation  forms  of  homophobic  act  in  Taiwan

campuses  with  localized  view  to  further  describing  homophobic  experiences  that  most

LGBTQ+  students  might  have  encountered.  This  study  uses  thematic  analysis  method  from

qualitative research method, conducting individual interviews with three participants. First, the

topics that three interviewees’ shares are presented, following the subtopics under the topics

are described, and finally a comprehensive analysis is carried out.

This result shows that homophobic experiences around LGBTQ+ students contain three

divided compositions: LGBTQ+ students perceive insufficient gender-diversity sensitivity on

campus,  LGBTQ+  students  experience  homophobic  behavior,  The  Cycle  of  Internalized

Homophobia  by  Gay  Students.  Overall,  all  the  three  interviewees  reported  experiences  of

microaggressions, which not only comes from their peers but also from faculty members, which

affects their exploring about sexual orientation and self-identity constructing at the time. By

analyzing  and  arranging  the  interviewee's  data,  it  pointed  out  how  important  the  gender-

diversity  sensitivity    in  the  campus,  by  universalize  the  perspectives  of  gender  diversity,  it

could help peers accepting more about LGBTQ+ students, and teachers could be more sensitive

to  provide  assistance  to  LGBTQ+  students  .In  the  discussion  of  this  study,  we  found  that

homophobic acts have changed into the form of microaggressions, and when LGBTQ+ students

230

still  had  to  lives  in  such  unfriendly  campus,  it  may  eventually  causes  LGBTQ+  students

developing  states  of  internalized  homophobia,  which  further  affects  their  self-identity  in  a

negative  way.  Theses  result  shows  the  importunacy  and  urgency  to  build  gender-diversity

sensitivity in the campus.

This research focus on the homophobic experience in Taiwan campuses. Taiwan's culture

and legal system are also to be considered to unify the connotation of homophobia in localized

campuses, which brings a deeper discussion about homophobia on campuses in Taiwan, and

also pointed out that if gender-diversity sensitivity could become more universal around the

campus,  it  might  bring  more  understanding  and  acceptance  between  most  students  and

LGBTQ+  students,  the  faculty  members  might  also  more  capable  to  provides  decent  help

towards  LGBTQ+  students  by  gain  more  awareness  about  the  existence  situation  of

microaggressions around the campus that harms students, The findings of this study not only

provide suggestions and references for educators and professional helpers, but also serves as a

reference for future research on LGBTQ+ students and their experiences.

I. Preface

In  recent  years,  the  implementation  of  gender  equality  education  in  schools  has  been

widely  discussed,  primarily  since  the  "Gender  Equity  Education  Act"  was  implemented  18

years ago. Has the campus environment implemented a gender-friendly campus environment

with  the  promulgation  of  this  law?  On  May  24,  2017,  the  Supreme  Court  interpreted  the

Constitution in the Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 748, which mentioned that the marriage

rights of Tongzhi (LGBTQ+) should be protected by the judiciary (Act for Implementation of

J.Y. Interpretation No. 748, 2017 ), followed by a referendum on November 24 the year after

that, in which the fourteenth case "Civil Law Protection of Same-Sex Marriage" was declared

unsuccessful with a disapproval rate of 67.26% and an agreement rate of 32.74%; the same was

not passed is also the 15th case, "Explicitly Enacting Gender Equality Education in Primary

and Secondary Schools into Law". The disapproval rate of the case was 65.99% higher than the

yes vote rate of 34.01%, and the case was declared failed (Central Election Commission, 2018).

May  2019  On  the  17th,  the  Legislative  Yuan  passed  the  "Act  for  Implementation  of  J.Y.

Interpretation No. 748", making Taiwan officially the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex

marriage  (Legislative  Yuan,  2019).  The  passage  of  the  LGBTQ+  special  law  is  a  big  step

forward for LGBTQ+ equality, but in an atmosphere where society has not entirely accepted

LGBTQ+, through the referendum mentioned above data and the implementation of the law, it

can  be  found  that  Taiwanese  society  generally  does  not  agree  with  the  implementation  of

LGBTQ+ marriage and gender equality education, which caused a conflict between law and

public opinion even when the law was finalized first. Although the fundamental human rights

of LGBTQ+ are protected by law, they may need to face more social discussions; in society,

education,  and  even  on  campus,  it  is  difficult  to  immediately  change  the  public's  attitude

towards the LGBTQ+ ethnic group by adjusting the legal system. The degree of acceptance,

especially on campus, seems to be becoming gender-friendly due to the implementation of the

"Gender Equity Education Act." However, gender equality incidents on campus still occur one

after another. Chang (2019) pointed out that gender-unfriendly campuses expanded after the

referendum. Bullying is becoming more and more apparent; the Taiwan LGBTQ+ (LGBTQ+)

Hotline Association’s Taiwan LGBTQ+ (LGBTQ+) Student Experience Survey Report (2021)

on teenagers aged 13 to 18 years old shows Taiwan’s campus environment still cannot make

LGBTQ+ students feel safe, and when LGBTQ+ students are generally afraid to seek help when

being harassed. Taiwanese campuses are full of prejudiced remarks, and these discriminatory

232

remarks come not only from peers but also from faculty and staff. This shows that there is still

room for improvement in the situation of LGBTQ+ students on Taiwanese campuses.

Chang and Wang (2009, 2010) and Chang et al. (2013) pointed out in their research on

college students’ attitudes towards LGBTQ+ that most college students take a supportive stance

toward the protection of LGBTQ+’s human rights. However, when it came to an interpersonal

level towards LGBTQ+ students, whether it is love, friendship, or sympathy, the acceptance

level of relationships is low. This change cannot help but make researchers think about what

kind of peer relationships LGBTQ+ students will experience on campus. Is it like the above

study? It was found in the survey that LGBTQ+ students who seem to accept their LGBTQ+

identity still maintain a reserved or even non-accepting attitude in interpersonal relationships;

the  research  by  Wang  et  al.  (2018)  mentioned  the  sexual  orientation  microaggressions

experienced  by  female  LGBTQ+  students  in  their  lives.  ,  peers  inadvertently  reveal  their

rejection and non-acceptance of the LGBTQ+ ethnic group in their daily lives; the research of

the  Tongzhi  hotline  (2021)  still  shows  that  peers  and  faculty  are  still  unfriendly  towards

LGBTQ+,  which  shows  that  the  homophobic  atmosphere  on  campus  is  not  a  noticeable

improvement.  Based  on  the  above  research  background  and  motivation,  it  is  hoped  that  by

understanding the homophobic behaviors experienced by Taiwanese campus students during

their studies, the localized homophobic patterns on Taiwanese campuses can be sorted out by

summarizing  the  interviewees’  experiences.  Therefore,  the  purpose  of  this  study  is  to

understand the homophobic experiences LGBTQ+ students encounter on campus in Taiwan.

II. The Definition of Homophobia and the Homophobic Atmosphere in Society

1. The Connotation of Homophobia and the Current Situation of Homophobia in Society

The  term  homophobia  was  proposed  by  George  Weinberg  in  1967.  He  believed  that

homophobia was an irrational disgust - a condemnation of LGBTQ+'s irrationality (Weinberg,

1973);  and  Herek  (2004)  divided  homophobic  hostility  into  three  aspects:  sexual  stigma,

heterosexism, and sexual prejudice. Homophobic ideology passes  through culture and social

structure, causing the public to internalize homophobic consciousness and gradually shape it.

The stigmatization of LGBTQ+ further degrades and deprives LGBTQ+ of his rights. The book

"Stigma: Notes on Managing Damaged Identities" also mentions that stigma has a powerful

derogatory  effect,  especially  when  it  conflicts  with  our  attributes  or  does  not  match  the

stereotype. We subconsciously label  the other person, do not  contact them,  and then isolate

233

them  (Goffman,  1986/2010);  the  enormous  social  pressure  makes  the  LGBTQ+  group  feel

suffocated.

The LGBTQ+ ethnic group in Taiwanese culture needs to be careful about their sexual

orientation being exposed in society to avoid public stigma and labeling due to their sexuality.

Luo  et  al.  (2005)  pointed  out  in  their  research  that  due  to  the  heterosexual  hegemony  and

patriarchy  in  society,  Under  the  power  system,  through  the  process  of  stigmatization  and

labeling, the fact of the existence of the LGBTQ+ ethnic group has been denied, and this social

background  has  also  constructed  a  social  environment  that  resists  and  discriminates  against

LGBTQ+;  described  above  for  homophobia,  LGBTQ+  Identity  is  stigmatized  as  wrong,

immoral, etc., and through the process of stigmatization, the existence of LGBTQ+ is denied

(Swigonski, 2006); and on the basis that heterosexuality is regarded as "normal" in society, all

People are assumed to be heterosexual until LGBTQ+'s identity is revealed (Haddad, 2019).

LGBTQ+, frustrated in society, cannot express his plight in his family. Under the influence

of traditional Confucian culture, Taiwanese families have a more conservative attitude towards

the sexual orientation and gender temperament of the LGBTQ+ ethnic group. Wang et al. (2014)

pointed out in their research the public has reservations about LGBTQ+ but does not encourage

it, and about 60% of the people will educate their children not to become LGBTQ+; about 50%

of the people said that if their children are LGBTQ+, their sexual orientation will be corrected.

If their children's sexual orientation cannot be corrected, it will prevent  LGBTQ+'s children

from  developing feelings. The identity of  LGBTQ+’s children  challenges traditional marital

values. Such a challenge violates the sexual and moral behavior of moral face (Zhu, 1991), and

the  principle  of  face  sharing  in  Chinese  culture  will  also  cause  the  family  to  be  morally

evaluated (Han & Li, 2011). Such constant negative evaluations in society and families put the

LGBTQ+ ethnic group under tremendous pressure in their daily lives, which in turn affects the

physical and mental health of the LGBTQ+ ethnic group.

Luo et al. (2005) mentioned in their research that if you want to improve the stigmatization

of  LGBTQ+  in  society,  you  need  to  start  with  education.  However,  implementing  gender

equality  education  on  campus  is  full  of  thorns.  In  2014,  the  Tongzhi  hotline  held  a  press

conference titled "Gender Equity Education Has Become a Black Box, Friendly, and Diverse

Slogans Are  Left Behind  - A General  Review of the 10th  Anniversary of  Implementing the

Gender  Equity  Education  Act."  It  was  mentioned  that  gender  equality  education  has  not

advanced but retreated in the past ten years. The hot potato is that the different policies of the

central and local governments have made it challenging to implement gender equality education,

and the law has covered up the unfriendly campus environment. The "Gender Equity Education

234

Act" has instead become an illusion of maintaining a diverse and friendly campus, and when

teachers devote themselves to Gender equality education courses are subject to complaints and

obstruction from parent groups, which puts teachers in a dilemma during teaching, and caused

everyone in the education sector to remain silent. Wang (2019) believes that this situation has

affected  teachers’  teaching  profession  because  such  Due  to  the  influence  of  the  social

atmosphere, LGBTQ+'s situation on campus is not very optimistic.

2. Different Forms of Homophobia on Campus

Wright  et  al.  (1999)  divided  homophobia  into three  constructs,  "cognition,"  "emotion,"

and "behavior."  In terms of cognitive constructs,  George Smith proposed the "gay to death"

ideology  in  2005.  This  ideology  excluded  and  isolated  LGBTQ+  students  while  reinforcing

gender  stereotypes,  which  strengthens  the  mainstream  culture  of  heterosexual  hegemony.

LGBTQ+  students  must  maintain  a  heterosexual  role  and  avoid  becoming  a  "target"  and

attracting attacks from peers by keeping the appearance of gender stereotypes. Chen's 2010 high

school  vocational  study  mentioned  that  the  higher  the  degree  of  acceptance  of  LGBTQ+  if

disadvantaged  students  know  gender  diversity;  conversely  if  they  do  not  understand  gender

diversity (including gender stereotypes), the degree of acceptance of LGBTQ+ will be lower,

which shows the importance of gender diversity education.

On the emotional level, for example, Chang and Wang (2009, 2010, 2013) pointed out in

their research on college students' attitudes towards LGBTQ+ that most college students took

a  supportive  stance  towards  the  protection  of  LGBTQ+'s  human  rights  and  returned  to

emotionally  related  interpersonal  relationships,  love,  and  friendship.  In  sympathy  and  other

aspects, the acceptance is low; the research results of Chen (2010) mentioned that the lower the

students' understanding of LGBTQ+ students, the lower the acceptance, and vice versa. The

results of the two studies show that Having diverse gender knowledge is a significant factor for

students to accept the gay community. The cognitive level affects the acceptance of peers, and

the two levels are closely related.

In  terms  of  behavioral  constructs,  Horn  and  Nucci  (2003)  mentioned  that  LGBTQ+

students often experience homophobic behavior from peers on campus; Smith (2005) also noted

that peers treat LGBTQ+ students in ways such as verbal bullying, exclusion, and harassment;

Sue (2007) summarized microaggressions into the following three types: Microassaulting refers

to conveying derogatory attitudes and messages through verbal or non-verbal messages, which

is  more  obvious  discrimination  or  prejudice,  such  as  verbal  insults  or  behaviors.  Deliberate

235

avoidance; Microinsulting, usually an unconscious attack, which means there is no intention to

attack, but the content derogates the identity and culture of a particular ethnic group, or there is

no  sensitivity  that  such  words  and  deeds  demean  the  identity  or  identity  of  others;

Microinvalidating  refers  to  the  unconscious  exclusion  of  specific  groups,  or  the  failure  to

believe that society oppresses or treats them differently, and belittles the reality experienced

and  understood  by  specific  ethnic  groups.  Sue  (2010)  proposed  sexual  orientation

microaggressions, which are manifestations of derogation, hostility, or contempt for gender-

diverse  groups  in  daily  life  in  the  form  of  verbal,  behavioral,  and  environmental  attacks,

whether intentional or unintentional. Both overt and covert homophobic behaviors constitute

an unfriendly environment for LGBTQ+ students on campus. It also makes LGBTQ+ students

live on campus in fear and hide their LGBTQ+ identities at every step. Such a perilous campus

environment also affects the physical and mental health of LGBTQ+ students.

From the literature mentioned above, we know that homophobic ideology on campus has

caused much harm to the gay community, in addition to interpersonal rejection and physical

attacks. As shown in the "LGBTQ+ Stress Situation Questionnaire" of the “Taiwan Alliance to

Promote Civil Partnership Right［TAPCPR］”, up to 58% of LGBTQ+ respondents have been

harmed by others in different forms. The main form of harm is verbal violence, accounting for

91% of the percentage, followed by interpersonal rejection at 54% (Jian, 2012) while LGBTQ+

Students  are  harmed  by  homophobic  behavior  on  campus,  causing  them  to  feel  unsafe  on

campus, which in turn affects LGBTQ+ students' campus adjustment. For example, data from

the Tongzhi Hotline (2021) pointed out that 35.6% of LGBTQ+ students felt unsafe on campus,

and  49.9%  of  LGBTQ+  students  expressed  that  they  wanted  to  avoid  campus  gatherings

(morning meetings, sports meetings); 4.9% of LGBTQ+ students had done so in the past month.

After being absent for at least one day, 7.6% of LGBTQ+ students have transferred to another

school, which seriously affects the campus life of LGBTQ+ students. Nearly ten years after the

survey, homophobic incidents still occur on campus, which shows the stagnation in creating

gender equality and gender-friendliness on campus. This issue deserves attention.

In summary, understanding the homophobic behavior that occurs on Taiwanese campuses

is  an  issue  worthy  of  attention.  From  a  legal  and  social  perspective,  the  legal  protection  of

Tongzhi’s human rights has caused a gap between the law and the referendum results. In the

TAPCPR (Jian, 2012) and Tongzhi Hotline (2021) studies, we can glimpse the difficulties faced

by the Tongzhi ethnic group on campus. Since there are few local studies on the homophobic

experiences  of  Tongzhi  students  on  campus  in  Taiwan,  this  study  hopes  to  enrich  domestic

236

research  by  providing  a  glimpse  into  the  homophobic  experiences  of  Tongzhi  students  on

campus, in order to better help Tongzhi students face their difficulties.

III. Research Methods

1. Data Collection and Research Tools

To understand the experience of LGBTQ+ students encountering homophobic incidents

on  campus,  this  study  collects  data  through  individual  interviews.  Through  the  interview

interviews of homophobic experiences on campus, we can understand the forms of homophobia

on campus. The interviews in this study adopted semi-structured interviews, with the interview

outline  as  the  central  axis  and  in-depth  interviews  with  the  interviewees.  Interview  outline

topics include:

(1) Understand LGBTQ+ students ’experiences of experiencing diverse gender sensitivity on

campus

(2) Understand LGBTQ+ students’ experiences of internalized homophobia on campus

(3)  Understand  LGBTQ+  students’  experiences  of  experiencing  homophobic  behavior  on

campus

This study recruited respondents for a preliminary screening of conditions. The content of

the preliminary screening includes:

(1) Confirm the basic information of the interviewee

(2) Preliminarily understand the interviewee’s experience sharing

(3) Clarify respondents’ questions about the study

The preliminary screening confirmed that the interviewees had enough experience to meet

the  interview  data  collection.  It  also  takes  the  opportunity  of  the  preliminary  screening  to

establish a trusting relationship with the interviewees, clarify the interviewees' doubts about the

research,  explain  the  principles  of  confidentiality  and  informed  consent,  and  confirm

Respondents understood the purpose of the research, their own rights and interests, and their

willingness to participate in the research through preliminary screening.

During the interview process, the researcher asked neutrally and objectively to avoid the

researcher's  values  from  affecting  the  content  shared  by  the  interviewee  and  expected  the

interviewee to speak freely; if there was a digression from the topic, the researcher promptly

reminded  the  interviewee  and  guided  the  topic  back  to  the  topic.  The  entire  interview  was

recorded. The content of the audio file is only used for this study and the researcher's master's

237

thesis. The interviewees' personal information and identifiable information will be anonymous

or presented in the form of code names.

The research tool also includes the researcher himself. The researcher himself is from the

LGBTQ+ ethnic group. The researcher is also on campus and cannot help but feel that there is

still  some  unfriendliness  towards  LGBTQ+  on  campus.  The  relevant  experiences  of  the

researcher’s  friends  serve  as  research  ideas.  To  further  discuss  the  current  situation  of

homophobia on campus, the researcher has considerable enthusiasm and continuous attention

to the issues of the LGBTQ+ ethnic group. As in a LGBTQ+ ethnic group, the researcher can

conduct more in-depth interviews from a perspective closer to the interviewees. The supervising

professor is  a collaborative analyst  with  professional  knowledge, practical  work experience,

and academic research experience in counseling. The collaborative analyst also follows privacy

and ethical regulations and provides clarification and verification of research methods and data

analysis,  especially  when  analyzing  data.  During  the  process,  the  researcher  was  assisted  in

reviewing the verbatim manuscript and checking whether the coded data was consistent.

2. Research Participants

This  study  recruited  three  research  participants  through  purposive  sampling,  and

individual interviews lasted about 1.5 to 2 hours to collect relevant experiences of the research

participants. There are three screening criteria are as follows:

(1) Aged 20 to 28 years old. Limiting this age group not only considers the adult status of the

participants but also  considers that respondents over 28  years old may be affected by social

experience due to generational differences, resulting in bias in data collection, so the age group

is limited to 20 to 28 years old and still studying in Taiwan, four people filled out the registration

form.  One  person  was  not  invited  to  the  interview  stage  because  he  was  over  28,  so  three

interviewees were interviewed.

(2)  Students  studying  in  Taiwan’s  colleges  and  universities.  The  three  interviewees  are  all

Taiwanese nationals who have studied in Taiwan. The experiences they shared are based on

personal experiences and observations of Taiwanese campuses.

(3) Have experienced homophobia or witnessed it on campus.

This  study  recruited  interviewees  through  online  platforms  and  classes  and  invites

interviewees interested in the research topic and meeting the conditions. The summary of the

three interviewees is shown in Table 1.

3. Data Analysis

This study adopted a qualitative research design. Compared with large-scale quantitative

research,  qualitative  research  can  capture  more  details  and  the  meaning  behind  it  through

meticulous  records,  in-depth  interviews,  and  observations  and  can  study  minority  groups.

Specific situations or special events provide unique perspectives and explore the diversity of

different perspectives and experiences; researchers can also incorporate factors such as social

interaction,  cultural  background,  and  personal  experience  to  understand  better  and  interpret

research results.

This study used the thematic analysis method to analyze the verbatim manuscript. Through

the  steps  of  familiarizing  with  the  data,  coding,  seeking  preliminary  themes,  revising  and

adjusting  the  theme,  and  defining  the  purpose  and  significance  of  the  theme,  the  verbatim

manuscript  was  finally  summarized  and  organized(Wu  &  Chang,  2020  ),  supplemented  by

239

formulating the theme of the interview outline, integrating and summarizing the data collected

from  the  interviews,  and  to  consider  the  accuracy  of  the  research,  cross-checking  with  the

supervisor and co-analyst when sorting out the verbatim draft, and through this avoid the values

of LGBTQ+ researchers from interfering with the presentation of research results, to reduce

researcher bias and improve the credibility of data analysis.

4. Research Ethics

The researcher also participated in 30 hours of courses at the Taiwan Academic Ethics

Education  Resource  Center  in  2019  and  3  hours  of  the  Central  District  Research  Ethics

Workshop in 2020 and complied with research ethics during the research process. To ensure

the  well-being  and  related  rights  of  the  interviewees,  before  individual  interviews,  the

researcher  and  the  interviewees  read  the  consent  form  for  participating  in  the  research,

explaining the research topic, purpose, interview time, recording permission, confidentiality,

confidentiality exceptions, and other interviewee rights, and explain that during the interview,

the interviewee has the right to stop sharing and withdraw from the interview. If questions are

unwilling to be answered or shared during the interview, the interviewee can remain silent. To

ensure the  confidentiality  of the interview space, the location was arranged in  an individual

counseling  space  of  the  school  where  I  attended.  The  entire  interview  process  was  kept

confidential. All personal information and related information mentioned in the presentation of

the research results were anonymous and replaced with code names. During the interview, the

interviewee must describe their life experience. If the interviewee has significant mood swings

during the interview, appropriate rest time and emotional support will be provided. After the

interview, the interviewee’s emotional state will be assessed and provided. None of the three

interviewees had relevant channels for seeking support.

IV. Research Results

Figure  1  presents  the  themes  and  sub-themes  summarizing  the  verbatim  transcripts  of

interviews  with  three  interviewees.  The  interviews  are  presented  in  terms  of  the  cycle  of

LGBTQ+  students  perceiving  insufficient  gender  diversity  sensitivity  on  campus,  LGBTQ+

students  experiencing  homophobic  behavior,  and  LGBTQ+  students

internalizing

homophobia—materials  and  sub-topic  content,  and  finally  a  comprehensive  analysis  and

discussion with the three research participants.

240

Figure 1

Summarizing Thematic and Sub-thematic Concepts of Homophobic Experiences

1. LGBTQ+ Students Perceive Insufficient Sensitivity to Gender Diversity on Campus

This  theme  includes  LGBTQ+  students’  perception  of  low  peer  acceptance,  LGBTQ+

students’  perception  that  teachers  do  not  have  gender  diversity  knowledge,  and  LGBTQ+

students’ lack of campus system and resources, making LGBTQ+ students feel unfriendly. By

analyzing  the  verbatim  transcripts  of  the  interviews,  it  was  found  that  when  peers  lacked

knowledge about gender diversity, they treated LGBTQ+ students in an avoidant and alienating

manner. When teachers did not know about gender diversity, they were unable to detect the

plight of LGBTQ+ students and were unable to provide any advice. LGBTQ+’s students offered

immediate assistance, and the teacher himself was an influential figure on campus. When the

teacher was unaware of the situation, he set an example and invisibly maintained the structure

of heterosexual  mainstream  culture. The mutual  influence of the two made The situation of

LGBTQ+ students on campus increasingly tricky.

(1) LGBTQ+ Students Feel Low Acceptance by Their Peers

241

The interviewees all mentioned the degree of acceptance of their own gender temperament

and  sexual  orientation  by  their  peers.  Especially  during  the  schooling  stage,  the  degree  of

acceptance of LGBTQ+ students by their peers is of profound significance. When peers do not

understand  LGBTQ+  students,  they  tend  to  distance  themselves  from  them  and  become

alienated.

  (Elementary school) Maybe boys want to look a certain way, and girls want to look

a certain way, so someone like me, who is more middle-of-the-road or girly, won’t be

accepted. Maybe they can be friends in private but not on stage. (H014)

(Junior high school) This identity seems to prevent me from establishing relationships

with many people. (P029)

(2) LGBTQ+ Students Feel That Their Teachers Do Not Have Gender Diversity Knowledge

The interviewees' experiences all mentioned the attitude of teachers. When teachers cannot

understand  gender  diversity,  they  will  bring  mainstream  heterosexuality  into  teaching  and

education, causing LGBTQ+ students to receive messages that they are different from others

and  make  more  severe  remarks.  It  will  be  directly  mentioned  that  non-heterosexuals  have

problems that need to be corrected. T's experience mentioned that when teachers avoid the topic

of gender diversity, LGBTQ+ students will worry about their teachers' opinions, which leads to

them having to worry about how their teachers view LGBTQ+ students' identities when asking

for help; P recalled that he had an incident with his peers on campus at that time. During the

conflict, the teacher quickly identified P as having a problem with his sexual orientation rather

than a fight between peers and realized that the teacher's remarks at the time were quite biased.

Teachers who do not have multi-gender knowledge also need to pay attention to the power

level of the teachers themselves. When teachers do not have multi-gender knowledge and are

unaware that their role has power, the asymmetry in power levels will cause more significant

harm to LGBTQ+ students. Hurt, H’s experience mentioned his experience of asking for help

because  the  teacher  could  not  respond  to  H’s  questions,  and  because  of  the  teacher’s

authoritative role, H’s fear of LGBTQ+’s identity deepened.

  (Junior high school) He just asked me what kind of behavior you have and what you

have  done  with  netizens.  I  think  he  made  me  feel  that  everyone  in  society  is  very

242

homophobic. I think that the teacher was also amazed. This seemed to be the first time

in his life that a student had told him about this matter. He didn't seem to have the

background or knowledge, so he didn't give me any support or help. I felt that it was

a pretty wrong decision to go there that time because he didn't give me any help and

then harmed me, and I was even more afraid that he might leak it or something or

what he would think of me. (H046)

Teachers are not very good at talking about this topic openly. If you want to ask the

class  teacher  or  discuss  your  sexual  orientation,  you  will  worry  about  what  the

teacher will think of you. Then I think the teacher is more likely to avoid this topic.

Whether  they  are  young  or  old  teachers,  they  will  avoid  this  topic  unless  they  are

open-minded teachers. (T021)

  (Elementary school) Because what he said was not that what I did was wrong; he

meant that my sexual orientation was wrong. I was confused then because I thought I

was here to be scolded for doing something wrong, but why does it mean that my state

is wrong and my sexual orientation is wrong. (P024)

(3) The Lack of a Campus System and Resources Makes LGBTQ+ Students Feel Unfriendly

The lack of gender diversity among teachers in elementary schools, junior high schools,

and high schools maintains a heterosexual mainstream campus atmosphere, and the influence

of their peers on LGBTQ+'s atmosphere deepens the failure of LGBTQ+ students to conform

to traditional gender values. The two intertwine to form a negative attitude toward LGBTQ+

on campus—an unfriendly environment. The interviewees said that the campus environment at

the  junior  high  school  and  high  school  levels  failed  to  provide  space  for  understanding  and

discussing  diverse  gender  issues  and  failed  to  establish  a  campus  environment  that  made

LGBTQ+ students feel safe. Only in college did they discover that campus can discuss diverse

gender issues. In particular, T mentioned in the interview that there were few opportunities to

be exposed to activities related to gender equality on campus before the university, so LGBTQ+

students  did  not  have  enough  resources  on  campus  to  deal  with  their  confusion  about  their

identity. P mentioned that the campus atmosphere made P unable to feel safe on campus and

was deeply disturbed by it.

243

  (Junior High School) The atmosphere in our school does not go out of its way to talk

about gender equality. It should be similar to other schools. Because of the religious

covenant, it does not go out of its way to promote gender equality. Don't discriminate

against this; it's just that the students themselves will know that this is the case. (T004)

  (High school) For me,  that was my situation at that time, and to  be honest,  these

things are just small things in life, but they occupied my high school life. There was

hardly a moment when I felt safe in school. (P008)

2. LGBTQ+ Students Experience Homophobic Behavior

This  topic  organizes  the  categories  of  homophobic  behaviors  mentioned  by  three

interviewees: both explicit aggression and microaggression. During the analysis process, it can

be concluded that obvious and overt homophobic behaviors gradually turn into more subtle and

difficult-to-detect  forms  of  microaggressions  during  the  different  stages  of  schooling.  For

LGBTQ+  students,  microaggressions  can  be  found  in  daily  jokes  and  games  and  may  be

mentioned  intentionally  or  unintentionally.  Because  microaggressions  are  challenging  to

identify and detect, even if LGBTQ+ students are in an atmosphere of microaggressions, their

peers and teachers may not be able to detect this phenomenon but reasonably believe that these

microaggressions are ordinary remarks and behaviors.

(1) LGBTQ+ Students Experience Explicit Attacks

Overt  aggression  is  an  easily  identifiable  homophobic  behavior.  It  treats  LGBTQ+

students  through  language,  body,  relationship,  etc.,  which  affects  LGBTQ+  students'

interpersonal  relationships  and  campus  adaptation  on  campus,  especially  verbal  attacks.  All

three interviewees mentioned they have become "numb" and "accustomed" to verbal attacks. It

can be seen that LGBTQ+ students have suffered from verbal attacks during their studies and

can only face this dilemma by ignoring and getting used to it. Physical attacks are mainly the

experience  shared  by  H.  In  junior  high  school,  peers  used  physical  attacks  to  demonstrate

"masculinity"  and  believed  that  H,  who  did  not  conform  to  masculine  qualities,  should  be

"punished";  relational  aggression  refers  to  ostracizing  LGBTQ+  students  by  attracting  other

peers and causing harm to LGBTQ+ students through interpersonal relationships. Regarding

interpersonal alienation and pressure, the interview data are presented in order below.

244

a. Verbal Attack

Verbal attacks are common homophobic behaviors. As LGBTQ+ students, H and T said

they have heard so many that they have become numb. LGBTQ+ students are forced to get used

to  these  verbal  attacks  during  their  studies.  They  seem  not  to  care,  but  these  remarks  have

caused great or small damage to the lives and minds of LGBTQ+ students. There are too many

examples of verbal attacks to be recorded. Here, we mainly present the information mentioned

by the interviewees.

  (Elementary  school)  Then  he started talking,  and it felt  like everyone was  talking

about  me, and then he  would  keep laughing at  me, and then he would  think I was

disgusting, and he would feel like he was being verbally attacked. (H027)

Joking,  verbal  bullying,  etc.,  all  happen  to  some  extent,  but  I  think  the  damage  is

relatively small and becomes a habit. (T009)

  (High school) For example, before boys, there might be ball games and so on, so if

someone is not in good condition. He might scold him and say, "Did you sell your ass

yesterday?" So, I didn't perform well today, but  they gave me the feeling that they

were  more  discriminatory  and  directly  regarded  this  matter  as  a  curse  or  a  joke.

(T017)

b. Sexual Bullying

H mentioned apparent physical attacks in the interview. In junior high school, male peers

used physical attacks to show their unacceptance of H's gender temperament. They expressed

through "punishment" that if they did not meet gender expectations, they should be treated in

this way. This behavior strengthened gender stereotypes and the school's unfriendly atmosphere

towards  LGBTQ+,  and  the  physical  attack  mentioned  by  H  was  very  sexual.  In  this  way,

LGBTQ+ students were sexually degraded.

  (Junior high school) Maybe that boy was unhappy, so he would find a group of boys

to bully me. They thought they were going to rape me, but they didn't realize that it

would expose their body, but it was just a group of people pressing you down and just

messing with you. It's just a group of boys holding me down or doing something, so I

can't resist. (H024)

245

(Junior high school) The boys in the first grade of junior high school sometimes have

to queue up for the toilet, and then they only have to pee, so sometimes they have to

queue and don't dare to go when there are many people. Occasionally they tease me

when they are interested or suddenly think of something like, "Let's take a look at the

sissy's dick," and then he will start to come and see you pee or take off your pants or

something like that. (H040)

c. Relational Aggression

Interviewee T mentioned that after his LGBTQ+ identity was revealed, he became more

cautious when getting along with his peers. He was worried that his peers would tell others

about his sexual orientation and attract other students to view T in a different light.

  (High school) Then, when I get along with them, I feel very stressed; that is, I have

to be very careful in what I say. I don’t know if one of them will look down on me

again and speak ill of me in the whole grade. (T014)

(2) LGBTQ+ Students Experience Microaggressions

In the part about microaggressions, the content of the three interviewees all mentioned a

wealth  of  information.  Whether  it  was  what  H  mentioned:  LGBTQ+  is  considered  to  be

heterosexual  and  should  be  grouped.  This  is  a  way  of  classifying  heterosexuality  as  the

mainstream, and the LGBTQ+ ethnic group is another; as T mentioned his experience of being

forced to come out in the interview, even though the campus may be friendly, peers ignore the

pressure that coming out may cause to LGBTQ+ students and lead to unfriendly looks from

others. In P's personal experience, LGBTQ+ students are most profoundly used as material for

big adventures. Shame and contempt for LGBTQ+ students are shown through jokes and games.

However, such joking material is the life experience of LGBTQ+ students. . The experiences

mentioned  by  the  interviewees  are  classified  as  follows:  LGBTQ+  students  experience

malicious  discrimination,  LGBTQ+  students  experience  their  identities  being  classified  and

belittled, and LGBTQ+ students experience their own experiences and feelings being denied.

a. LGBTQ+ Students Experience Malicious, Discriminatory Behavior

In  P’s  experience,  peers  belittled  P’s  LGBTQ+  status  in  a  risky  way,  treating  P’s

handshake as a risky game, conveying that P was someone they were unwilling to interact with,

246

and  making  P  feel  that  his  peers  regarded  him  as  a  disgusting  person.  By  packaging  the

derogatory behavior towards others in a game, it hurts LGBTQ+ students.

  (High school) There was a group of classmates playing games on the tour bus. They

also knew my identity as Tongzhi. Suddenly, a boy approached me and asked if I could

shake his hand. Then I said OK, and I shook hands with him like this, and then the

people behind them were taking photos and videos like this. Then I realized one thing:

this was their big adventure, that is, their big adventure, and the content of their big

adventure was to hold my hand. (P013)

b. LGBTQ+ Students Experience Their Identities Being Categorized and Belittled

All three interviewees mentioned that their peers on campus may subconsciously divide

LGBTQ+  students  into  one  category.  They  think  that  they  accept  and  respect  LGBTQ+

students' identity, but they subconsciously divide themselves and LGBTQ+ students into two

groups.  They  did  not  realize  that  such  classification  belittled  the  identity  and  identity  of

LGBTQ+  students  or  that  the  LGBTQ+  ethnic  group  was  used  as  material  for  jokes  and

discussions in daily life. Although the target was not necessarily LGBTQ+ students, LGBTQ+

students still felt their identity was not recognized. Respect that one's identity and identity can

be treated as a joke or a topic of discussion.

  (High  school)  seems  to  be  a  very  heterogeneous  group  to  them,  so  if  you  are

heterogeneous, you should be classified together, and heterogeneous people should

like each other. This is a really, very bad feeling. (H060)

I've heard quite a few people say, "It's OK if you're gay, but don't let it happen to me."

"There are quite a lot of people who say this. Whether they are in junior high, high

school, or even university, quite a lot of people do this. They won't say discrimination

or anything like that, but they say: "They respect it but don't want it to happen to them.

This is true for me.' They are they will show that they are heterosexual. (T005)

  (High school) They would say, "Hey, you know what? That so-and-so is gay," then

the other person will say, "Oh, that's true.”  Anyway, it felt more like a mockery at that

time. When I was a freshman in high school, it was true that I was forced to come out

because of this incident. This incident affected me to some extent. I felt very uneasy

247

and  worried  about  what  would  happen  if  my  sexuality  was  known.  Something  will

happen. (T013, T018)

  (High school) Everyone will think that gender temperament and sexual orientation

are things that can be joked about. Still, they never considered the jokes they made,

the materials they used to joke about, and the materials they found disgusting, is our

living life. (P020)

c.  LGBTQ+  Students  Experience  Their  Own  Experiences  and  Feelings  Being

Denied

In P's experience, peers ignored the existence of the LGBTQ+ ethnic group during the

conversation, thinking that  the number of  LGBTQ+ ethnic  groups  was  "not that large."

They inadvertently ignored the inevitability of the LGBTQ+ ethnic group's existence while

P experienced his own LGBTQ+ identity or membership in the LGBTQ+ ethnic group.

The existence of LGBTQ+ is denied.

  (University) He said something at that time. He said that he didn't think there were so

many  Tongzhi  in  the world.  As  a Tongzhi,  I  have  a  feeling  that  this  air is  xenophobic,

denying the existence of so many of us to some extent. When he said that sentence, it gave

me a feeling that he would make me feel that maybe it wasn't toward me, but there was

another Tongzhi whose existence was denied. (P038)

3. The Cycle of Internalized Homophobia among LGBTQ+ Students

The  interviewees  mentioned  the  concept  of  gender  stereotypes.  When  the  heterosexual

mainstream  structure  is  maintained  on  campus,  LGBTQ+  students  will  internalize  gender

stereotypes  and  form  internalized  homophobia,  directing  attacks  and  criticisms  on  campus

towards  themselves,  affecting  LGBTQ+  to  explore  and  develop  self-identity.  LGBTQ+

students  who  internalize  homophobia  will  also  turn  against  and  even  attack  other  LGBTQ+

students  because  this  cycle  of  internalized  homophobia  becomes  part  of  the  homophobic

environment.

  (1)  LGBTQ+  Students  Internalize  Homophobia  and  Refuse  to  Accept  Other  LGBTQ+

Students

248

Peers  require  LGBTQ+  students  to  conform  to  gender  expectations.  When  LGBTQ+

students receive these evaluations, in addition to the pressure of criticism, it also affects their

own  identification  with  gender  temperament  and  sexual  orientation.  The  homophobic

environment makes LGBTQ+ students not only learn the traditional gender framework but also

subtly instill the idea that people who do not belong to the heterosexual mainstream culture are

considered  to  be  different.  LGBTQ+  students  who  live  on  campus  day  after  day  gradually

internalize homophobia.  Such internalized homophobia not  only  hinders  LGBTQ+ students,

but  The  exploration  of  sexual  orientation  also  makes  it  difficult  for  LGBTQ+  students  to

establish their own identity. For example, H mentioned in the interview that he did not want to

admit his LGBTQ+ identity due to his lack of acceptance and approval from his peers. LGBTQ+

students thus internalize gender stereotypes.

  (Junior High School) Maybe we were all homophobic in the past. I also felt the same

way but wouldn’t say it out loud. I may know that I am gay, and I remember that I was

deeply impressed in junior high school. It was me. I felt weird, and then I thought I

might be sick because there were no such cases, yes, so I was also terrified at that

time, and then I agreed that this was the case. (H042)

  (High school) I don’t want to admit that I am an LGBTQ+ student, and I don’t want

to come out like this, and I don’t want to be friends with that friend who may be a

Tongzhi student. I feel that everyone will classify me as an LGBTQ+ student. You are

all Tongzhi students who are gay, and then you will think this is a terrible thing, so I

am very opposed to it. (H056)

LGBTQ+  students  who  have  internalized  gender  stereotypes,  in  addition  to  feeling

conflicted  and  confused  about  their  own  identity,  also  turn  their  internalized  homophobic

concepts  towards  not  accepting  other  LGBTQ+  students,  believing  that  other  gay  students

should also hide their characteristics; if any LGBTQ+ students behave showing his LGBTQ+

identity, other LGBTQ+ students may attack him to express that LGBTQ+ students should not

show LGBTQ+ identity. In the interview, H mentioned that when he mentioned junior high

school, he felt that he should remain anonymous and should not reveal his sexual orientation.

He could use attacks to suppress LGBTQ+ students who showed off their characteristics too

much.

249

  (High school) I would feel like I wanted to attack him, and I would feel that he was weird;

how dare he be so blatant or dare to come out? It didn’t seem OK or appropriate for him

to be like this. If I couldn't accept it anymore, I might really attack his sexual orientation.

Although  I  am  also  LGBTQ+,  I  don't  dare  to  behave  like  him.  Maybe  he  can  be  an

LGBTQ+ student, but he cannot behave like this, because LGBTQ+ students should live

their lives anonymously. They should not show it directly like this: it cannot be discovered,

cannot be known by everyone, and cannot emphasize their identity so much. This is how

this matter should be hidden, so as not to be discovered. (H065)

V. Comprehensive Discussion

1. The Experience of Hiding Homophobia on Campus in Taiwan

From the analysis results of this study, it was discovered that no matter what homophobic

experiences  LGBTQ+  students  encounter,  it  seems  to  be  regarded  as  an  ordinary  and

accustomed event on campus, as if they are ignored in an invisible campus. During the analysis

process, this study observed that the current status of homophobia in elementary schools, junior

high schools, and high schools may be related to the stage of development. The homophobic

behavior in elementary schools mainly comes from the alienation and rejection of multi-gender

students due to incomprehension. In junior high schools, Sexual curiosity at the beginning of

the stage is also reflected in homophobic behaviors with mainly sexual connotations in the H

experience. In high school and even college, in a more subtle and implicit form, for example,

in  the  research  results,  multi-gender  students  experience  microaggressions.  Therefore,  the

researcher  hypothesized  that  with  the  different  stages  of  schooling,  homophobic  behaviors

gradually  changed  from  explicit  and  easily  identifiable  homophobic  behaviors  to  jokes  and

games in daily life, which implicitly ignored and belittled LGBTQ+ students. In this way, the

observations and hypotheses will require further research and verification. The three lesbian

interviewees in Wang et al.'s (2018) study all expressed that they felt uncomfortable and angry

when

they  were  subjected

to  microaggressions.  These  seemingly

innocuous  and

inconsequential little jokes are what LGBTQ+ students do every day. All need to endure daily

life.

This  study  also  found  that  interviewees  had  difficulty  sharing  their  experiences  with

microaggressions. Compared with obvious "discrimination," the concept of microaggressions

250

is relatively unfamiliar to LGBTQ+ students, and interviewees sometimes felt uncomfortable.

The  idea  that  you  are  overthinking  is  something  that  needs  to  be  overcome  in  research.

Therefore,  a  more  precise  definition  and  explanation  of  the  concept  of  microaggressions  is

required to gain a deeper understanding of the plight of gender-diverse students on campus. In

addition, in the discussion of sexual orientation microaggressions, this study found that Taiwan

has little discussion on the homophobic experiences of multi-gender students on campus. Diana

and Kim (2022) mentioned in the Hong Kong study that educators and professionals need to

consider the unique cultural influence discussed in foreign countries from the perspectives of

religion, racial discrimination, and other aspects of sexual orientation microaggressions, with

special mention of the importance of school sex education and training of school professionals.

If  there  is  not  enough  understanding  and  adequate  attention  to  microaggressions  on

campus, microaggressions will continue to damage those persecuted's lives and living standards

(Nadal, 2018; Williams et al., 2021). However, when teachers and peers are not sensitive to

gender  diversity,  these  jokes  are  not  taken  seriously.  Even  teachers  are  unaware  of  the

phenomenon  of  microaggressions  and  unintentionally  acquiesce  in  the  rationality  of

microaggressions,  justifying  peers'  use  of  LGBTQ+'s  student  status  as  material  for  jokes.

LGBTQ+ students also have difficulty asking others for help. Microaggressions in daily life are

everywhere  on  campus  for  LGBTQ+  students.  LGBTQ+  students  are  exposed  to  this

atmosphere  without  escape,  but  few  people  know  this  phenomenon.  Regarding  sexual

orientation microaggressions in Taiwan, it is necessary to consider how factors such as Taiwan's

culture,  legal  system,  and  social  atmosphere  affect  the  campus  to  understand  better  the

challenges that Taiwanese campus students will face on campus so that we can better assist

Taiwanese campus students. It is also hoped that LGBTQ+ students can freely explore different

possibilities during their studies instead of being like flamingos trapped in the framework of

traditional culture and suffering stigma and extended fear while establishing self-identity. The

influence  of  peers  has  caused  damage  to  LGBTQ+  students'  physical,  mental,  and  learning

rights.

2. LGBTQ+ Students’ Internalized Homophobia

It  can  be  found  from  the  research  results  that  if  LGBTQ+  students  are  in  a  campus

environment full of microaggressions and unable to seek help from their teachers, their campus

life will be in a dilemma, and they will be in a difficult situation. It will be even more difficult

for  LGBTQ+ students  to explore their sexual  orientation  and self-identity. The homophobic

251

environment makes LGBTQ+ students not only learn the traditional gender framework but also

subtly  instill  the  idea  that  non-heterosexual  mainstream  culture  is  heterosexual.  LGBTQ+

students who live on campus day after day gradually internalize homophobia. Homophobia),

Chiu (2019) described internalized homophobia as LGBTQ+ directing external hostility and

attacks  towards  themself,  leading  to  devaluation  of  his  own  self-worth  and  impaired  self-

concept,  causing  LGBTQ+'s  own  identity  to  become  conflicted,  confused  and  even  Not

accepted. Such internalized homophobia not only hinders LGBTQ+ students from exploring

their sexual orientation but also makes it difficult for LGBTQ+ students to establish their own

self-identity. For example, in the research results, H internalized gender stereotypes and attacks

on  gays  and  lesbians.  Hostility,  based  on  such  internalized  homophobia,  hinders  the

development  of  one's  own  self-identity.  The  stress  of  sexual  minorities  and  internalized

homophobia are also positively correlated with depressive symptoms (Liang & Huang, 2021).

Internalized homophobia not only has a negative impact on the mental health of diverse gender

groups, but LGBTQ+ students also suffer from internalized homophobia. Factors do not accept

LGBTQ+'s  ethnic  peers,  and  this  cycle  of  internalized  homophobia  makes  the  hostile

environment towards LGBTQ+ even more powerful.

3. The Importance of Diverse Gender Sensitivity

This study refers to the concept of multicultural consultation proposed by Sue et al. (2007)

and believes that schools should also pay attention to the training of teachers and students in

"awareness," "knowledge," and "skills" to build the ability of teachers and students to be aware

of multi-gender students, through knowing their culture, values, and prejudices. Suppose peers

are not sensitive to multiple genders.  In that case, they tend to  avoid and exclude LGBTQ+

students, which causes LGBTQ+ students’ interpersonal relationships on campus to be affected

by their own LGBTQ+ identity. This not only results in insufficient interpersonal support for

LGBTQ+  on  campus  but  also  affects  LGBTQ+  students’  views  of  themselves.  Identity

recognition and the attitudes of peers, teachers, and influential figures on campus are even more

critical. If teachers do not have multi-gender sensitivity, they cannot lead students to understand

multi-gender temperaments and sexual orientations objectively in education. Moreover, when

LGBTQ+ students encounter microaggressions, teachers can be sensitive to their situation and

assist. As mentioned in the report of the LGBTQ+ Counseling Hotline Association (2021), the

failure  of  campuses  to  deal  with  discriminatory  speeches  may  send  the  message  that

homophobic  behavior  is  tolerated,  and  the  inability  of  teachers  to  detect  microaggressions

252

subtly makes the microaggressions reasonable. Under the intertwined influence of these factors,

the campus has become a hotbed of tacit approval of homophobic behavior. Teachers maintain

the  structure  of  homophobic  behavior,  and  peers  become  the  executioners  of  homophobic

behavior.  LGBTQ+  students  are  exposed  to  a  campus  environment  with  a  homophobic

atmosphere, as the childhood of LGBTQ+ students is generally trapped in a cage. Here, I quote

interviewee P’s appeal to teachers in the interview:

Inaction,  especially  inaction  in  terms  of  power,  to  some  extent,  maintains  this

structure. (P043)

VI. Research Conclusions and Suggestions

1. Conclusion

This study analyzed the interview data of three interviewees and put forward three points

in  the  comprehensive  discussion:  LGBTQ+  students  perceive  a  lack  of  gender  diversity

sensitivity  on  campus,  LGBTQ+  students  experience  homophobic  behavior,  and  LGBTQ+

students  internalize  the  cycle  of  homophobia—expectations  adding  to  existing  research  on

sexual  orientation  microaggressions  on  campus.  Regarding  three  interviewees'  educational

backgrounds: The "Gender Equity Education Act" has been implemented for over ten years.

According to the interviewees' experiences, the discussion of gender diversity in the educational

environment of senior high schools, junior high schools, and elementary schools is still quite

restricted.  It  was  not  until  the  campus  atmosphere  of  universities  turned  to  a  more  open

discussion  that  such  gaps  in  LGBTQ+  education  were  caused.  It  is  tough  to  discuss  gender

equality issues below high school. However, the schooling stage is when LGBTQ+ students

urgently need resources. For instance H in junior high school due to gender temperament. The

experience of being physically attacked is the same as Chen's (2021) study, which mentioned

that gay men mostly have negative experiences in junior high school and are prone to physical

bullying and attacks. These adverse experiences affect the self-identity of LGBTQ+ students,

if you wait until college to access resources related to gender equality, it may be too late.

2. Suggestions

(1) Further Research on Specific Aspects of Homophobic Behavior on Campus

253

As  mentioned  in  the  comprehensive  discussion  in  this  study,  issues  such  as

microaggressions  and  multi-gender  sexual  violence  suffered  by  multi-gender  students  on

campus are easily overlooked. Campus life has a profound impact  on multi-gender students,

including interpersonal relationships, internalized homophobia, Self-identity, etc., and requires

more people to pay attention to this issue. Therefore, it is recommended that future research

pay attention to the above issues and have a more in-depth and careful look at the patterns of

homophobic behavior on campus to  provide practical  workers with  richer information.  ,  for

complete professional advice on this topic.

(2) Suggestions for Practical Workers

Jiang and You (2022) mentioned in the study that gender equality education only sees the

dilemma  of  homosexuality.  Teachers'  understanding  of  sexual  minorities  is  limited  to

homosexual orientation while ignoring other sexual minorities. Practical workers should learn

more about and understand different genders. To help gay students with the difficulties they

may  face.  This  study  also  believes  teachers  are  essential  in  establishing  a  friendly  campus

environment for multi-gender students. For teachers, teachers can be aware of the atmosphere

of  sexual  orientation  micro-aggressions  that  occur  on  campus  and  then  help  multi-gender

students  and  educate  them  in  the  process.  Reflect  on  whether  you  bring  traditional  cultural

values and influence students' understanding of gender diversity. The most important thing is

whether  teachers  realize  that  they  are  power  representatives  on  campus  and  are  careful  to

discuss gender diversity objectively during the teaching process to avoid becoming role models

for homophobic behavior.

Regarding issues related to microaggressions encountered by diverse genders, campuses

should establish a friendly and open space for understanding diverse genders, pay attention to

potential  microaggressions  on  campus,  and  reflect  on  possible  homophobic  behaviors  on

campus through awareness, knowledge, and skills learning. In terms of sex education
